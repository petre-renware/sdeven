## Preamble

This procedure treat production and planning meetings that take place in software development process.

!!! info "Agile SCRUM compliance"
    Procedure follow Agile SCRUM methodology recommendations for meeting types.

From this perspective the meetings has two important sessions (aka discussion pannels, sections).

These sessions should be clearly marked on meeting agenda, meaning should be clear from agenda level what is the *principal session objective*:

* **planning** for next with **`PLAN`** _code-name_ typically used
* **review** of what was done with **`REVW`** _code-name_ typically used

Of course, in each session inherently can happen things of both types, but *the principal session objective* should be just one of them.




## Type of meetings

The **OPME** meetings can be basically classified from 2 perspectives:

* *objective* that was shortly discussed in previously section and can be a mix but with clear sections (discussion pannels)
* *frequency* of repetition and *duration* of each one

The **OPME** meetings are highly thought out to fit into the previous classifications WITHOUT CREATING mixes within each class or at least MINIMIZING the mixes.
