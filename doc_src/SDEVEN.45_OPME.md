## Preamble

This procedure treat production and planning meetings that take place in software development process.

!!! info "Agile SCRUM compliance"
    Procedure follow Agile SCRUM methodology recommendations for meeting types.

From this perspective the meetings has two important sessions (aka discussion pannels, sections).

These sessions should clearly marked on meeting agenda, meaning should be clear from agenda level what is the *principal session objective*:

* **planning** for next with **`PLAN`** _code-name_ typically used
* **review** of what was done with **`REVW`** _code-name_ typically used

Of course, in each session inherently can happen things of both types, but *the principal session objective* should be just one of them.
