<!-- #NOTE how to use me

- this file should be included as is in a `index.html` as will automatically redirect in `content` seconds

- carefully use it in Markdown files as the `md_to_html` converter add its HTML DOCTYPE and meta tags

- consider **`redirect_templare_2.md`** for a "pure" Markdown Implementation
