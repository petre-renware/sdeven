**Table of Content**

[TOC]

## Preliminaries

The code of ethics and professional conduct outlines the principles that govern decisions and behavior at a company or organization. They give general outlines of how employees should behave, as well as specific guidance for handling issues like harassment, safety, and conflicts of interest.

## A. Ethic Code

A code of ethics is broad, giving employees or members a general idea of what types of behavior and decisions are acceptable and encouraged at a business or organization. A code of conduct is more focused. It defines how employees or members should act in specific situations.

### A1. Be inclusive

We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social and economic class, educational level, color, immigration status, sex, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

### A2. Be considerate

We all depend on each other to produce the best work we can as a company. Your decisions will affect clients and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

### A3. Be respectful

We won't all agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behavior. We will all experience frustration from time to time, but we cannot allow that frustration become personal attacks. An environment where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive or creative one.

### A4. Choose your words carefully

Always conduct yourself professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Harassment and exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Threats of violence.
* Insubordination.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Sharing sexually explicit or violent material via electronic devices or other means.
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

### A5. Don't harass

In general, if someone asks you to stop something, then stop. When we disagree, try to understand why. Differences of opinion and disagreements are mostly unavoidable. What is important is that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

### A6. Make differences into strengths

We can find strength in diversity. Different people have different perspectives on issues, and that can be valuable for solving problems or generating new ideas. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that we all make mistakes, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere.

Instead, focus on resolving issues and learning from mistakes.

## B. Professional Code

A professional code address those issues related strictly to work environment and derives from necessity of a good, human reasonable, effective, efficient and pleasant working in / with teams.

### B1. Work environment

Employees should act with integrity, comply with laws, maintain a professional work environment and comply with company policies. They should treat customers, colleagues, and partners ethically at all times.

### B2. Conflicts of interest

A company's reputation depends on the actions and integrity of its employees. It is essential that they avoid relationships and activities that hurt, or appears to hurt, their ability to make objective and fair decisions.

### B3. Protecting company assets

Employees should always act to protect company assets, including physical, intellectual, and electronic or digital properties.

### B4. Anti-bribery and corruption

A company's integrity is essential for maintaining trustworthiness and reputation. Employees should always do their work fairly, honestly, and legally.

### B5. Attendance and punctuality

Employees are expected to be regular and punctual in attendance. This means being in the office, ready to work, at starting time each day. Absenteeism and tardiness burden other employees and the company.

### B6. Absence without notice

Employees who are unable to work due to illness or an accident should notify their supervisor. This allows the company to arrange for coverage of their duties and helps others continue to work in their absence. If an employee does a report for work and the company is not notified of an employee's status for 3 days, it is typically considered a job abandonment.

### B7. General harassment and sexual harassment

This company is committed to providing a work environment free of discrimination and unlawful harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual’s sex, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic are not tolerated.

### B8. Cell phone use at work

Personal cell phone usage during work hours is discouraged, except in extreme cases such as an emergency.

### B9. Dress code

A professional appearance is important when employees work with customers or potential customers. Employees should be well-groomed and dressed appropriately for the business and for their position.

### B10. Substance abuse

The manufacture, distribution, possession, sale, or purchase of controlled substances of abuse on company property is prohibited. Being under the influence of illegal drugs, alcohol, or substances of abuse on company property is prohibited. Working while under the influence of prescription drugs that impair performance is prohibited.

### B11. Tobacco products

The use of tobacco products on company property, outside of permitted areas, is specifically prohibited.

### B12. Internet use at work

Employees may use the Internet when appropriate to access information needed to conduct a business company business. Use of the Internet must not disrupt or injure the company computer network. Use of the Internet must not interfere with an employee's productivity.

## C. Legal issues

Legal issues refer to those aspects where a software product / system interfere with legal aspects. From developer point of view these are very much related to personal information regarding end users of system and their potential comfortably related to personal data of confidential nature.

Other legal aspects are subject of a specialised department of company.

### C1. Potential confidential data

* identification official codes, by official meaning they are subject of any personal official document
* personal adress of residence
* personal phone number
* personal email
* any personal banking information
* passwords and user names / id-s
* name of family members
* other sensitive and personal data, like incomes, revenues, expenses, religious data, color (skin, hair, etc), dressing, etc

### C2. How to avoid potential problems

First of all it is important to keep in mind that for violating some legal issues, THERE IS NOT ANY REASON, even if the reason was a good intention... Law is law and has nothing to do with good intentions, but always has to do with bad intentions,so DO NOT SUPPOSE ANYTHING, better is to ask if you're not sure and ready to assume all consequences.. 

So, here you'll find some simple rules:

* do not write any out of specifications code, ie, "hidden code"
* do not collect any personal data (see previous section) without user consent
* store any personal data using different encryption mechanisms; if not specified in system design then use hashing
