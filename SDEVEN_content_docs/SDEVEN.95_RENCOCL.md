**Table of Content**

[TOC]

## Preamble

This section is about projects confidentiality with particular aspects to software development.

## Overview of classification in RENware company

In **RENware** company, classification follows the "standard" practices, just applied in almost all of cases to projects level (there could be exceptions but these are announced specially). So, the are the following levels:

* ***UNCLASSIFIED*** projects - these are public projects; they are not marked
* ***STANDARD*** projects - these are the most projects and classification applies IN PROJECT SCOPE; they are marked as **RESTRICTED. ONLY FOR PROJECT INTERNAL USE**
* ***CONFIDENTIAL*** projects (aka TOP projects) - these are usually company internal projects, such as research projects; they are marked as **CONFIDENTIAL. ONLY FOR PROJECT INTERNAL USE**
* ***STRICT CONFIDENTIAL*** projects - these are projects "*reserved*" for RENware top management stuff

## Software development perspective

Ref to this point of view, *ALL PROJECTS THAT BELONGS IN A WAY TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT* (ie, specific as software development or just  have parts which involves software development) are as **DEFAULT at STANDARD** level of classification. This means that for these projects, even if they are not marked, the rules of "**RESTRICTED. ONLY FOR PROJECT INTERNAL USE.**" must be **AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED**.

No person (does not matter if is employee or freelancer or other third party) is (will be) allowed to work with this kind of projects IF NOT has signed an agreement regarding to:

* information "manipulation" inside and outside of project
* code of conduct, part ref to legal issues

All project documents are to **RESTRICTED** level, and the responsibility to approve exceptions belongs to:

* for all 100^[1], 800 and 900 documents to *Project Manager*
* by exception, for *130-SKIT* documents, to *Product Manager*
