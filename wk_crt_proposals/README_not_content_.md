**What is to be found here**

This directory is intended to keept continuous proposals 
and current work. As long as some parts are reviewed and 
considered ok / valuable they should be moved in a corresponding 
release version and (usually) dropped off as to avoid risk 
of duplication or retreating them as new issues.

For partial reviews and acceptances on documents, there is 
a good practice NOT TO DROP them, but mark as USED / MOVED.
