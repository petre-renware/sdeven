<h2 id="sdeven.10_adm-projects-and-teams-organization">Projects and teams organization</h2>
<h3 id="sdeven.10_adm-project-aspects">Project aspects</h3>
<p>A project is officially started through a management decision. This could be an informal one, but for a <em>clear</em> team allocation, budget, stuff nomination, etc, a written document published internally is preferred. </p>
<p>Basically projects can be normal / <strong>standard</strong> ones (ie, with standard classification rules) or <strong>classified</strong> with more strict rules regarding access to their information. </p>
<p>Other normal taxonomy establish projects as <strong>internal</strong> (for internal company use or for research) or <strong>external</strong> for those being a target beneficiary of project results. </p>
<h3 id="sdeven.10_adm-team-aspects">Team aspects</h3>
<p>Teams are dynamically allocated per projects as needed. (<strong>DYNAMIC ALLOCATION</strong>) Any member allocated a time frame on a project will follow (in that time frame) the specific project rules and organization. (<strong>STATIC ALLOCATION</strong>) Out of allocation time frame will follow the fixed / administrative pattern.</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.10_adm-applicable-procedures">Applicable procedures</h3>
<p>For a detailed description of project management policies refer the applicable <em>Project Management Methodology</em>.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.10_adm-working-technical-environments">Working technical environments</h2>
<p>Working environments can be classified as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>development</em> - usually on personal computer, but could be situations where one or more development servers are needed especially for remote work, operating system issues, processing power, testing on more "real" machines, etc</li>
<li><em>test</em> (aka QA-envs) - for testing issues, regardless by which members are (to be) done</li>
<li><em>production</em> systems - also for testing issues but used in final stages, just before committing work to client users. These environments should be as much as possible very appropriate to a real machine that exists in current use at client</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.10_adm-escalation-procedures-and-practices">Escalation procedures and practices</h2>
<p>From this perspective a software project should be seen like any other project. Therefore is anything special than normal procedures used in <em>Project Management Methodology</em>.</p></section><section class="print-page" id="sdeven.20_renpra"><p><small><strong>SDEVEN Software Development &amp; Engineering Methodology</strong></small></p>

<h2 id="sdeven.20_renpra-preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>This procedure contains common used practices of development work especially when using standard <code>git</code> systems. Objective is to assure a good level of communication, exchange information, synchronizing activities and work, presenting results and obtain best benefits.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.20_renpra-general-common-and-frequent-aspects">General common and frequent aspects</h2>
<p>Here is a list with the most common and frequent situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>never change ANYTHING ref a <em>closed version</em>. Better is to create a new issue instead of changing the existing one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>organize development issues in <em>sprints</em> as small chunks of changes that have clear objective, specs (following Agile principle) and a short enough deadline to remain "<em>useful &amp; valuable</em>" at finish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when work at an issue make a dedicated branch, and MAKE STRICTLY WHAT IS INTENDED, EXPECTED,  REQUIRED TO DO, otherwise so it will be difficult to reverse work in case of something goes wrong and is not in issue objective. This usually will high impact the quality of result and clearly the deadline term. Respect the principle that states "when you do something, do ONLY THAT THING and do it WELL".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.20_renpra-branches-and-repository">Branches and repository</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>always make a branch for each change / sprint, even is a short one (will allow you to quickly rollback work) - this branch should be locally on your development machine but is not mandatory, it could be remote and devops engineer should be notified</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>try to <em>avoid mixing with other branches</em> even if they're still yours (as work in progress)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.20_renpra-releases-check-list">Releases check list</h2>
<p>Here is a check list regarding most important issues that need attention before closing a release:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>check for still open, in progress sections; look for specific words like <code>wip</code>, <code>...</code> (ellipses), <code>todo</code>, <code>fixme</code>, <code>bug</code>, <code>need review</code>, etc. Ignore case when search for these words !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check release notes: if exists as separated file or there are marked in a clear way, not mixed with things intended or in work for other versions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check for version code (at least major, minor, patch) to be in according with roadmap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check technical documentation: specs for usage, notes for developers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check for end user documentation: updates, references that released features are available from version x, "how to use features", etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check the language used in end user intended documents to be as most as possible IMPARTIAL and avoid misinterpretations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check for other elements with impact on branding, such as logos, colors, fonts, etc</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.20_renpra-technical-issues-regarding-syncing-and-distributed-execution">Technical issues regarding syncing and distributed execution</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ref sync subject objects it is recommended to be accompany them with useful metadata at least with info ref to <em>last sync</em> date time stamp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in multi systems sync (more than 2 involved in sync process), every system should have its own list with targeted systems to be synced; this list itself is subject to sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>generally ref syncing it is recommended to use standard components and technologies, like <code>rsync</code> or derivate but largely enough used and maintained by producer; clearly should be avoided solutions that are available only on few systems (and in this case this should be explicitly documented)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ref distributed execution of processes it is recommended to use already known components that have enough support as community and are dependent only of other known components, for example for queues and pub / sub systems, Rabbit MQ, Redis, AMPQ, can be used; proprietary closed systems should be avoided (can be used only in custom / dedicated / turn key systems if the beneficiary want strictly a component)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in file names intended for code modules / parts / chunks AVOID the character dash (<code>-</code>). Replace it with underscore (<code>_</code>). In many languages the inclusion of the other files in code is made using some pre-processor directives (as <code>include</code>, <code>import</code>, <code>require</code>, and so on) and these directives does not always accept strings but directly filenames and often the dash character is treated as <strong><em>minus arithmetical operator</em></strong> which can lead to many <em>"hard to detect"</em> problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More information, techniques and practices can be find in template of <a href="#appendix_b_dsgn_content_index">Software Design document</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.20_renpra-tool-stacks-components-versions">Tool stacks components versions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>new (not enough tested in market) version of a toolstack component must be avoided, especially when is a core one for system where work is done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if a feature intended to be used is not backward compatible, before using or updating it must check for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the impact to already developed or in development code by any member</li>
<li>adoption of this version in standard operating systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Optional chapter</p>
<p>This chapter makes subject of <em>optional</em> recommended practices</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>always make a local (in function code) copy of received parameters. This is to minimizing risk of generating unwanted side effects, <em>except</em> you really want to change their values and this change to be "seen" by caller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>PAY ATTENTION that making a copy of parameters is not enough to avoid side effects</em>; if they are <code>mutable</code> (ie pointer, address) its update will alter the original value with unwanted side effect (unless is made intentionally)</p>

<h2 id="sdeven.25_sytest-preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
<p>The testing is one of the most important activity in software development as long as a piece of software is NOT written for own purposes.</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.25_sytest-why">Why</h3>
<p>The testing may <em>assure</em> you that a piece of software do what was intended to do. This is "one face" but testing must also assure the <em>owner</em> of the software for the same things. And finally must assure the <em>end users</em> (generally the customer) for same things, sometimes more things.</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.25_sytest-when">When</h3>
<p>The testing should be done first "internally" (ie, not in the presence of customer's people). Then some more complex, elaborated tests should be done in the customer presence (for customer confidence).</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.25_sytest-vocabulary">Vocabulary</h3>
<p>The testing process will involve some specific  terms and concepts like: <em>compliance</em>, <em>bug</em>, <em>acceptable</em>, <em>workaround solution</em>, ... These terms are not necessarily new terms but they will make more sense, will get a more clear meaning  "if are seen" from testing perspective.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.30_renver-preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>This section is about versioning scheme practiced by company.</p>
<p>Mainly this scheme is based on <em><a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning specifications</a></em> or in document <em><a href="#appendix_a_semantic_versioning">Appendix A Semantic versioning (SEMVER)</a></em> as appendix to this methodology.</p>
<p><em>Semantic Versioning</em> specifications have been adapted <em>regarding the qualification part</em> (NO CHANGE ref major, minor and patch).</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.30_renver-version-structure">Version Structure</h2>
<p>The structure of version string is: <strong><code>M.m[.p][-buildno][.qual]</code></strong>, where version parts represents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>M</code>, <code>m</code> and <code>p</code> are not explained here being exactly like accepted practices ref "<em>Semantic versioning</em>"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>buildno</code> is the build number with internal applicability and uniqueness identify any build regardless of other version elements / parts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>qual</code> is a qualifier and can be one of: <code>alfa | beta | preview | prerelease | release</code>; <strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: preview is just a prerelease but just with a "more commercial" name</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Defaulting version numbers</p>
<p>Default <code>patch</code>, <code>build</code> and <code>release</code> numbers will be considered latest (ie, <strong><em>biggest numbers</em></strong>) - see also <a href="#appendix_a_semantic_versioning">semantic versioning appendix</a></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>1.1.0-548.preview</em> major 1, minor 1, patch 0, build 058, preview qualifier version</li>
<li><em>2.1.1-621</em> major 2, minor 1 patch 1, build 621, last qualifier version</li>
<li><em>3.7</em> major 3, minor 7, last patch, last build, last qualifier version</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.30_renver-versioning-and-tagging-rules">Versioning and tagging rules</h2>
<p>The most desired situation is when tag names follow versioning principles, ie,name of tags are identically with tagged version.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the following rules must happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in branch <code>development</code> always close tags / versions with minimum <code>beta</code> qualifier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from branch <code>development</code> DO NOT promote tags with qualifier lower then <code>pre-release</code> to branch <code>master</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in branch master always close tags / versions with minimum <code>pre-release</code> qualifier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NEVER work directly in branches <code>development</code> or <code>master</code> - these are only for "collecting" work done in other branches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when you have (or just need) to tag the current work (and the qualifier cannot be set at minimum requirements) then <strong><em>just tag an "alpha" on your branch</em></strong> and continue your work on the same branch or on another (depends on your context) and somebody which is admin (maintainer) will make a QA (check &amp; quality assurance) branch from it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.30_renver-versions-by-branches-map">Versions-by-branches map</h2>
<p>This map shows the most desired actions in frequent and current situations regarding branches and tagging.</p>
<p>So it is organized by branches and shows what kind of version <strong>qualifiers</strong> are recommended for each one.</p>

<h2 id="sdeven.40_bran-preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>This section refers the current policies regarding <em>git repository</em> branches.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.40_bran-classification">Classification</h2>
<p>The branches are classified like that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>mandatory</em> (always required). As example is the <strong>master</strong> (or <em>main</em>) branch. The name <em>master</em> is preferred (as it is already used in automation scripts), but sometimes the name main can be found (as with best practices recommendations starting with spring of 2021 year).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with a <em>long life cycle</em> (aka just <em>development</em>). In this category is <strong>development</strong> branch which is required up to a minor release, then the name can be changed if needed to reflect versioning policy. Another example could be <em>release</em> beach intended for documentation review and finalizing and packaging of system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>test</em> branches which are created usually from an <em>alpha</em> or <em>beta</em> tag and kept until the required tests are passed. This kind of branches can return (merge) back to <em>development</em> corresponding branch or to a <strong>release</strong> branch if tests passed for preparing a potential release. In both cases, after test finalizing and branch merge, it will be deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>developer dedicated</em> branches local kept on remote git for a quick reference for all developers without requiring a git client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>personal</em> branches reflecting current work for developers that: <sup>(i)</sup> have a <code>git</code> client installed or <sup>(ii)</sup> remote for developers using mobile devices without a <code>git</code> client installed. For such as branches open on public remote<sup id="fnref:public_remote"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sdeven.40_bran-fn:public_remote">1</a></sup> <code>git</code>, the name of developer and phrase "<code>dev</code>" or "<code>phone</code>" and these branches <em>need to be requested from DevOps person</em> in order to crete them, give them enough rights and not to be (automatically) dropped.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.40_bran-branches-used-and-their-names">Branches used and their names</h2>
<p>Usually, as not stated otherwise in a project, the following branches should be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>development</strong> - consolidates development of all team. Branch is <em>permanent</em> and set as <em>default</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>master</strong> - current version of system in production. Branch is <em>permanent</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>xxx-dev</strong> - work branch for team member <code>xxx</code>. Branch is <em>temporary</em> and should be administered by the DevOps person. This kind of branch is made to work from different devices where a <code>git</code> client cannot be used and files must be individually uploaded or edit using the <code>git</code> system web interface. The person for whom it was created can receive full rights on this branch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>qa_test</strong> / <em>t</em>est<em> - used according to classification. Branch is </em>temporary*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>release</strong> / <strong><code>version_string</code>-rel</strong> - used according to classification. Branch is <em>temporary</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">master branch name</p>
<p>starting from 2022 new git systems are default configured to name default base branch as <strong><code>main</code></strong> instead of <code>master</code>. Please check to avoid mistakes due to branch name <em>use in different automation / configuration</em> <code>yaml</code> scripts.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.40_bran-frequent-mistakes">Frequent mistakes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>names containing "<strong><code>dev</code></strong>" are used to signify a "local" developer work. These should not be confused with <em><code>development</code></em> branch which has already an explained purpose. They are used by people that need a repository for their current work and cannot install a local client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>names containing "<strong><code>rel</code></strong>"  or "<strong><code>tst</code></strong>" or "<strong><code>qa</code></strong>" are intended for test purposes. This situation could appear <sup>(i)</sup> for own tests, <sup>(ii)</sup> for tests done by other people or <sup>(iii)</sup> for tests made before a release. Also, instead of making "release or test branches" when intention is for example not commit work but have a kind of snapshot with <em>"AS IS NOW"</em>, a tag can be created and transformed latter in a branch. This method is <em>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</em> for any kind of snapshots that are needed. Just pay attention with these tags and DO NOT EXPECT a long life cycle for them as anytime can be dropped by a <code>DevOps</code> that remarks they are out of used conventions and policies - a better option is just to communicate the intention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.40_bran-tagging-recommendations">Tagging recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>for consistency, long term and reference tags should be named using <em><a href="#sdeven.30_renver">RENVER</a></em> conventions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>working tags should contain words like <code>dev</code> or <code>adev</code> <em>(from alpha dev)</em> if not an <em>alpha</em> release is intended. This will help for a right alphabetically sort, normally their preceding an <em>alpha</em> or upper release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.40_bran-graphic-basic-flow">Graphic basic flow</h2>
<p>This diagram shows the basic flow for <code>master (main)</code>, <code>development</code> and one <code>xxx-dev</code> branch. Also on graphic the practices ref tagging are shown:</p>

<h2 id="sdeven.45_opme-preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>This procedure treat production and planning meetings that take place in software development process.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Agile SCRUM compliance</p>
<p>Procedure follow Agile SCRUM methodology recommendations for meeting types.</p>
</div>
<p>From this perspective the meetings has two important sessions (aka discussion panels, sections). These sessions should be clearly marked on meeting agenda, meaning should be clear from agenda level what is the <em>principal session objective</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>planning</strong> for next with <strong><code>PLAN</code></strong> <em>code-name</em><sup id="fnref:PLAN"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sdeven.45_opme-fn:PLAN">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>review</strong> of what was done with <strong><code>REVW</code></strong> <em>code-name</em><sup id="fnref:REVW"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sdeven.45_opme-fn:REVW">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, in each session inherently can happen things of both types, but <em>the principal session objective</em> should be just one of them.</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.45_opme-the-sprint-event-and-process">The <code>sprint</code> event and process</h3>
<p>Before discussing <em>OPME meetings</em> a brief description of <em><code>sprint</code></em> concept could be necessary.</p>
<p>The <strong><code>sprint</code></strong> term describe the process (named event in "<em>Scrum Guide...</em>") where ideas, things are put in practice. It is a normal <code>software development</code> process like any other one and has the following properties.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">sprint properties</p>
<p>It is a fixed length event of one month or less to create consistency. A new <code>sprint</code> starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous <code>sprint</code>. All the work necessary to achieve the goals / objectives including its <em>planning</em>, <em>review</em>, <em>execution</em>, etc happen within <code>sprints</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>These properties determine the nature of <em>software development approach</em> which, by using <code>sprints</code> becomes an <em>iterative</em> and <em>evolutionary (spiral model)</em> one.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.45_opme-type-of-meetings">Type of meetings</h2>
<p>The <strong>OPME</strong> meetings can be first classified using 2 perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>objective</em> (<strong><code>OBJ</code></strong> <em>code-name</em><sup id="fnref:OBJ"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sdeven.45_opme-fn:OBJ">3</a></sup>) that was shortly discussed in previously section and can be a mix but with clear sections (discussion pannels)</li>
<li><em>frequency</em> (<strong><code>FRQ</code></strong> <em>code-name</em><sup id="fnref:FRQ"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sdeven.45_opme-fn:FRQ">4</a></sup>) of repetition and <em>duration</em> (<strong><code>DUR</code></strong> <em>code-name</em><sup id="fnref:DUR"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sdeven.45_opme-fn:DUR">5</a></sup>) of each one</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>OPME</strong> meetings are highly thought out to fit into the previous classifications WITHOUT CREATING mixes within each class or at least MINIMIZING the mixes.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">OPME Meetings</p>
<p>The following types of meetings can be held:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>development planning</strong> (<strong><code>devPLAN</code></strong> <em>code-name</em>) meeting (Agile SCRUM equivalent event: Sprint Planning)</li>
<li><strong>operational schedule</strong> (<strong><code>devOPER</code></strong> <em>code-name</em>) meeting (Agile SCRUM equivalent event: Daily Scrum)</li>
<li><strong>operational review</strong> (<strong><code>devREVW</code></strong> <em>code-name</em>) meeting (Agile SCRUM equivalent event: Scrum Review)</li>
<li><strong>product goals review</strong> (<strong><code>prodREVW</code></strong> <em>code-name</em>) meeting (Agile SCRUM equivalent event: Scrum Retrospective)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.45_opme-devplan-development-planning"><code>devPLAN</code> development planning</h2>
<p>This meeting has goal to plan the start and execution of a <code>sprint</code> which will call <strong><code>sprintPLN</code></strong> in next. Also should note that a (any) <code>sprint</code> has a specific / principal objective (keep ONE to make sure the sprint is sprint !!!) which will be called <strong><code>sprintOBJ</code></strong> in next.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title"><code>sprintPLN</code> CONSTRAINTS</p>
<p>A <code>sprintPLAN</code> must take into account the following <em>constraint assumptions</em> during its execution:</p>
<ul>
<li>no changes will be made, especially changes that would endanger the <code>sprintOBJ</code></li>
<li>established quality (factors) will not decrease</li>
<li>the <code>sprint</code> corresponding <em>CHANGELOG</em> is refined as needed</li>
<li>scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner / Product Manager as more is useful <em>but having in mind first assumption</em></li>
<li>the <code>sprintPLAN</code> is the subject of ROADMAP file update</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>But <em>where comes from</em> the <code>sprint</code>? Well, it comes from a <em>list with issues</em>, usually found on ROADMAP file or a shorter list, but ROADMAP is the preferred place and this is "the way" SDEVEN recommend (<a href="#sdeven.55_trace">see also the SDEVEN.55_TRACE procedure</a>).</p>
<p>Otherwise, a <code>sprintPLAN</code> is absolutely similar to any other software development plan regarding an issue that has <em>a clear and completely defined finality</em>.</p>
<p>All the good practices and  technical rules in software engineering, for example regarding maintainability, <em>must be considered</em> as in any software development plan made with maximum responsibility and care in observing the rules of software engineering.</p>

<h2 id="sdeven.45_opme-devoper-operational-schedule"><code>devOPER</code> operational schedule</h2>
<p>The purpose of the <strong><code>devOPER</code></strong> is to inspect progress toward the <strong><code>sprintOBJ</code></strong> and adapt the specifications (initial ROADMAP information) as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.</p>
<p>The <strong><code>devOPER</code></strong> is a <em>15-minute to 20-minute</em> event for the developers of the <code>sprint</code> execution team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the <code>sprint</code>. All participants <strong><em>should act as developers</em></strong> regardless their actual position in project.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">

<h2 id="sdeven.45_opme-devrevw-operational-review"><code>devREVW</code> operational review</h2>
<p>The purpose of the <code>devREVW</code> is to inspect the outcome of a <strong>finalized</strong> <code>sprint</code> and determine future adaptations. The team involved (including project manager) presents the results of their work to <em>Product Manager</em> (and other key stakeholders if they are participating) and <strong>progress toward the <code>sprintOBJ</code></strong> is discussed.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the whole participating team review what was accomplished and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.</p>
<p>The <em>ROADMAP</em>, <em>CHANGELOG</em> and <em>RELNOTE</em> documents may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The <code>devREVW</code> is a working session and the team <strong><em>should avoid limiting it to a simple presentation</em></strong> of facts.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title"><code>devREVW</code> Properties</p>
<ul>
<li>principal objective: review</li>
<li>frequency: minimum at 2 weeks</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.45_opme-prodrevw-product-goals-review"><code>prodREVW</code> product goals review</h2>
<p>The purpose of the <code>prodREVW</code> is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The <em>Product Manager</em> and <em>Project Manager</em> (and if needed anyone else from product team) inspects how the last 'sprint' went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their assumptions and awareness regarding <strong>"definition of Work Done and Done Well"</strong>. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The discusses are focused on <em>what went</em> well during the 'sprint', <em>what problems</em> was encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title"><code>prodREVW</code> goal</p>
<p>The meeting goal is to identify the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the CHANGELOG and ROADMAP for the next activities.</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>prodREVW</code> concludes a <code>sprint</code> and its RELNOTE document. It will have a duration of maximum of three hours for a one-month <code>sprint</code>. For shorter <code>sprints</code>, the event is usually shorter.</p>

<p>This procedure is about <em>in development system</em> logging and trace issues, features, fixes, etc, generally speaking all "actions" like intentions, changes, proposals, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.55_trace-common-files-used-to-keep-tracking">Common files used to keep tracking</h2>
<p>The following files are mostly present in development projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CHANGELOG</strong> file - this keep record of all things done in development process - all changes or new things happened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ROADMAP</strong> file - this keep record of all things approved on project development roadmap (see <em>NOTE 1: Files with commercial impact</em>) - a template document can be found in <a href="#appendix_d_roadmap_template">file Appendix_D_ROADMAP_template.md</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RELNOTE</strong> file(s) - this keep the record of things already done in a released version, RELNOTE name is an acronym for "REALEASE NOTES" (see <em>NOTE 1: Files with commercial impact</em>) - a template document can be found in <a href="#appendix_e_relnote_template">file Appendix_E_RELNOTE_template.md</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of these files, projects can have some files dedicated to project management domain, the most usual files "seen by developers" being <strong><a href="#appendix_c_status_report">Status_report STATUSR - template in <code>Appendix_C_Status_Report.md</code></a></strong> (see <em>NOTE 1: Files with commercial impact</em>).</p>

<p>Speaking about situations, items or events that that must be traced, these could be of category:</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>bugs or "problems" category</strong> representing those things that create any kind of problems and should be fixed - these will be marked with <code>#FIXME</code> text to be recognized by editing platforms (most of IDEs platform have extensions for that) and visually highlight them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>notes or useful comments</strong> these will be marked with <code>#NOTE</code> text to be recognized by editing platforms (most of IDEs platform have extensions for that) and visually highlight them</p>

<h2 id="sdeven.62_pstr-preamble-and-goals">Preamble and goals</h2>
<p>This procedure contains usual project structure and it is just a recommendation. The <em>Project Manager</em> will organize the project in the best possible mode in order to to be relevant in specific project situations. A common practice is to start with these recommendations and to add (or refine) elements that reflects project particular aspects.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.62_pstr-project-basic-backbone-structure">Project basic backbone structure</h2>
<p>First level of project backbone consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>830-DEV</strong> - here will take place all system "active" development</li>
<li><strong>880-RLSE</strong> - here will be kept data for public releases - this directory is not be explained here, for details <a href="#sdeven.60_relm-release-directory-content-and-structure">see procedure 60-RELM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All product system code is kept under <code>830-DEV</code> directory. The objective of its structuring is to assure as much as possible code reusability and its "after-release" maintainability. This directory contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&lt;project root>/830-DEV/</strong> directory <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-project_root830-dev-directory">go to section</a> with <em>following structure</em>:<ul>
<li><strong>doc_src/</strong> <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-doc_src-directory">go to section</a></li>
<li><strong>docs/</strong> <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-docs-directory">go to section</a></li>
<li><strong>pjm/</strong> <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-pjm-directory">go to section</a></li>
<li><strong>setup/</strong> <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-setup-directory">go to section</a></li>
<li><strong>static_portal/</strong> <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-static_portal-directory">go to section</a></li>
<li><strong>sysInit/</strong> <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-sysinit-directory">go to section</a></li>
<li><strong>&lt;system_module_A>/</strong> - directory dedicated for &lt;system module "A"> <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-system_module_x-directory">go to section</a></li>
<li><strong>&lt;system_module_B>/</strong> - directory dedicated for &lt;system module "B"> <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-system_module_x-directory">go to section</a></li>
<li>... &lt;another system module>/ ... <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-system_module_x-directory">go to section</a></li>
<li><strong>Commons</strong>/ <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-commons-component">go to section</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these directories will be explained in next sections.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Naming conventions</p>
<p>To avoid conflicts and misinterpretations at programming language level it is recommended that in FILES and DIRECTORY NAMES to avoid characters space (<code></code>) and (<code>-</code>) and to replace them with underscores (<code>_</code>).</p>

<h3 id="sdeven.62_pstr-docs-directory"><strong>docs</strong> directory</h3>
<p>This directory will accommodate the <strong>FINAL</strong> (<strong>RELEASED</strong>) documentation static portal that accompanies the developed system. This is part of what is known as "Help Center" of that system This is mandatory for products from category "<em>ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS</em>".</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">remarks</p>

<h3 id="sdeven.62_pstr-pjm-directory"><strong>pjm</strong> directory</h3>
<p>Here are kept project management items that could be necessary in software development <sup id="fnref:pjm_docs"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sdeven.62_pstr-fn:pjm_docs">1</a></sup>, things like that:</p>
<ul>
<li>project contract</li>
<li>project tests &amp; acceptances procedures</li>
<li>deliveries content and schedule</li>
<li>... etc</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">project management documents</p>
<p>the project management documents make subject of Project Management discipline and will not be explained here or in other SDEVEN section</p>
</div>
<h3 id="sdeven.62_pstr-setup-directory"><strong>setup</strong> directory</h3>
<p>The aim of this directory is to keep code to install the system by this understanding the code that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>create all directory structure required to accommodate and run developed system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create all OS level users, groups or other administrative OS "items"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>install all required OS level dependencies and applications (for example a local particular database system, a system application used to manage the network components, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>install the framework(s) components that are required to run developed system (for example JRE for Java components, PHP Laravel, Python Flask, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>configure OS installed components in corresponding directories (for example on Linux some changes in directories <code>/etc</code>, <code>/var</code>, etc)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">setup components language</p>
<p>A general practice is to make setup components in usual OS scripting language (Bash, Power Shell, etc) but is not mandatory to do like that. A good practice is to use a language that:</p>
<ul>
<li>can assure enough independence of OS specific commands and "formats" (for example the directory separation character, <code>\</code> vs <code>/</code>)</li>
<li>can be executed on all known public OS-es (Linux, MacOS, Windows)</li>
<li>one of the "perfect" candidates is <em>Python 3</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="sdeven.62_pstr-static_portal-directory"><strong>static_portal</strong> directory</h3>
<p>This directory will accommodate the documentation static portal that accompanies the developed system. This is part of what is known as "Help Center" of that system This is mandatory for products from category "<em>ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS</em>".</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">how to create documentation static portal</p>
<ul>
<li>the company practice is to use <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">mkdocs</a> to build this portal</li>
<li>this directory is used for testing and validation resulted portal - released portal is kept in <a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-docs-directory"><code>docs/</code> directory</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="sdeven.62_pstr-sysinit-directory"><strong>sysInit</strong> directory</h3>
<p>The <code>sysInit</code> directory accommodates code that initialize all system modules. This system initialization routine <strong>SHOULD BE THE CENTRALIZED ONE</strong> meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>each system module / component must have its initialization code (<a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-system_module_x-directory">as described in "system module X"</a>)</li>
<li>the <code>sysInit</code> code centralize all modules initialization in <strong>correct order</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The code of <code>sysInit</code> module should be called repeatedly without generate side effects except that determine system initialization and loosing all sessions in work data. But repeating calls should all system data is correctly flushed and persisted and no <strong>UNEXPECTED</strong> <strong><em>missing</em></strong> (of course others that "unsaved data") or other files, configurations <strong><em>damage</em></strong> is happening.</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.62_pstr-system_module_x-directory"><strong>&lt;system_module_X></strong> directory</h3>
<p>The system must be designed following the next principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>must be structured in "independent <strong>modules</strong>" (see the next explanation)</li>
<li><strong>modules</strong> should interact between them ONLY:<ul>
<li>using parameters and returns</li>
<li>using defined interfaces (as recommended in OOP guides)</li>
<li>using a external shared - common - data component</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>interactions or communication between <strong>modules</strong> that require global variables should use the <strong>Commons</strong> component (<a href="#sdeven.62_pstr-commons-component">see Common section</a>)</li>
<li>should have their own <em>initialization</em> code callable from <code>sysInit</code></li>
<li>should have their own <code>README_moduleX.md</code> file containing specific technical specs and info (will become technical documentation)</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition question">
<p class="admonition-title">What means an independent module?</p>
<p>A software module can be considered independent enough when it can be "transformed" into a distinct library with an <em>acceptable work around</em> effort meaning without change or alter its functional code but only the required code to make it separated "package or library" (ie, the code that define its library definition)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="sdeven.62_pstr-commons-component"><strong>Commons</strong> component</h3>
<p>This component is a specialized module used to replace direct usage of <strong><em>global variables</em></strong>. It usually is implemented as a <code>class</code> object and take care of global variables by meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>assure their consistency such as they are critical regions</li>
<li>prevent circular references when using them (everybody import only <code>Commons</code> module)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Commons</code> component (if is present) should have data initialized by each module that post any global data and in <code>sysInit</code> module should be among the first created, if not the very first.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Commons component code-name</p>
<p>The <code>Commons</code> component has the name starting with <em>uppercase</em> especially to avoid confusions with <code>commons</code> name which can be used in more other contexts being an usual and general term. So, the idea is <strong>to use in clear <code>Commons</code></strong> instead of <code>commons</code> and to potentially get some warnings at least in stating / initializing phases...</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.62_pstr-project_root830-dev-directory"><strong>&lt;project_root>/830-DEV/</strong> directory</h2>
<p>In the project root directory will be at least these files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>README.md</code> which contains a kind of product data sheet with project information</li>
<li><code>project.toml</code> which contains project information like:<ul>
<li><em>name</em> - product / system / project code-name / short-name as known in organization</li>
<li><em>description</em> a short description of the project (just emphasizes the essence or "reason to ve" of product because more detailed information is offered through README)</li>
<li><em>version</em> is the product version (the product in that package !) and must conform all <a href="#sdeven.30_renver">SDEVEN versioning specifications</a></li>
<li><em>license</em> type</li>
<li>... more information, usually this file being also required by PACKAGING AND DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT used solution ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>requirements.txt</code> which contain product / system internal and libraries dependencies (just system level not OS level)</li>

<h2 id="sdeven.65_derev-preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
<p>This SDEVEN section presents some common design approaches (also used as review objective) practiced in company. The existing software engineering theory behind these approach is supposed to be known and understood by team members with role in software engineering (<a href="#sdeven.10_adm-development-and-research"><code>sen</code> role explained in "Administrative policies (SDEVEN.10-ADM)" section "Development and research"</a>).</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Review process and design approach</p>
<p>The review process is strongly correlated with design approach followed by project. This allows allows <em>compliance with standards</em> to be verified and to make "good, reliable and usable" recommendations after a code review.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.65_derev-audience">Audience</h2>
<p>Targeted audience is:</p>
<ul>
<li>designers, architects - to practice the ideas and guidelines of here</li>
<li>software engineers, technical leaders, product managers - to understand the design issues and impact on development</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.65_derev-introductory-and-approach-models">Introductory and Approach Models</h2>
<p>In SDEVEN there are 2 (two) kind of classic and traditional paradigms used for software development:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>waterfall paradigm</em> (aka sequencing) - design is a step that must be finished before development</li>
<li><em>incremental paradigm</em> (aka evolutionary) - design and development are made continuously, in small steps with returns from one to the other step</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">SDEVEN approach</p>
<p>Both paradigms are "good" and have their "pros and cons" for each project depending of its context. For that reason, SDEVEN methodology combine both approaches and apply <em>Agile</em> principles seeking to obtain <strong>best results</strong> by doing that.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.65_derev-basics-of-sdeven-approach">Basics of SDEVEN approach</h2>
<p>As already said, in SDEVEN both paradigms are used and combined, and when make <strong><em>a mix of them</em></strong> inherently a predominant one will result. This predominant one is mainly dependent of nature of product and intended features to be developed.</p>
<p>The <strong>Product Manager</strong> is responsible to decide what approach to be used in a particular situation. Here are listed the basic and <em>minimum</em> recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>if a waterfall approach is decided, then a <strong><code>major</code> and <code>minor</code></strong> version numbers should be considered <strong>ALWAYS</strong> and NOT only a patch version or just a build</li>
<li>an incremental approach can cause version numbers to be updated in an "out-of-order way" but this thing must be managed accordingly to remain <em>relevant and consistent</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Agile methods</p>
<p>As <em>Agile</em> approach, the following methods are recommended to be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCRUM</li>
<li>Extreme Programming (XP)</li>
<li>Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM)</li>
<li>Feature Driven Development (FDD)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">See also this Agile reference</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.65_derev-type-of-design-changes-in-sdeven-approach">Type of design changes in SDEVEN approach</h2>
<p>The following type of <strong>design changes</strong> must be considered related to <strong>Design Review process</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MA</strong> <em>design change</em> - this is considered a MAJOR change and it is happening when a <strong>completely new feature</strong> needs to be implemented, by "<em>completely new</em>" meaning there is no background relative to that feature. A <em>full analysis</em> should be made and <em>some related supplementary research</em> could be needed.
And all of these can generate collateral unexpected problems, even a design takes place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CR</strong> <em>design changes</em> - these changes appear as usually customers want some features but "staying in product scope / universe" (attn, in product scope does not necessarily mean in contract scope)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WIS</strong> <em>design changes</em> - these are kind of changes, out of project scope and they could present some important features regardless they comes as customer request or an internal idea; the experience to approach these changes exists but should be placed on product ROADMAP</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Applying customer changes</p>
<p>Customer changes are normally changes that does not update the product version, but are STRICT LOCALLY for that implementation. The decision to generalize and apply them TO PUBLIC PRODUCT RELEASE is at <strong><em>product management level</em></strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sdeven.68_corev-preamble-and-objectives">Preamble and objectives</h2>
<p>This section is about code review. The main <strong>objectives</strong> of a code review are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing knowledge</li>
<li>Sharing responsibility</li>
<li>Improving code structure</li>
<li>Learning</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A good and effective code review will cover all those aspects.</em></p>
<h2 id="sdeven.68_corev-technical-objectives-and-the-process">Technical objectives and the process</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The main purpose is to "detect" those code parts that can be <em>generalized and reused</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another purpose is to check the conformity to appropriate standards and practices (for example for a <code>Python</code> code to check if it respects <code>PEP</code> indications, or for a web server front end application if <code>HTML</code> specifications was followed, for a script if <code>ECMAScript</code> specification are followed, etc). This conformity is expected to keep at an ACCEPTABLE level, meaning at least fundamental principles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Who to execute code review?</p>
<p>A code review <strong>MUST</strong> be done by <strong>EXPERT</strong> level members, both by a <em>developer</em> and a <em>software engineer</em>. This will maximize the process results and can give best information regarding <strong>code generalization and reusability</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.68_corev-mob-technique-as-code-review-technique">Mob technique as code review technique</h2>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Mob technique as code review technique</p>
<p>SDEVEN recommends Mob technique ONLY for learning process when:</p>
<ul>
<li>junior members are used in coding process or</li>
<li>when adopt a new standard, language, generally speaking a new "thing" and the knowledge should be transferred to some people</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Mob programming</em></strong> means that <em>all required team members</em> are present in the same time in front of one screen. Or work remotely on a shared screen — that is my case.</p>
<p>First (the team or its leader) decide for a task (or issu<em>e treated as next action), and when possible we rotate in </em><strong>driving sessions</strong><em>. A session means there is </em>a one driver<em> — one who types / clicks, and </em>one navigator<em> — which tells the driver what to do. The other team members </em><em>keeps attention</em><em>, and only when the navigator goes in a wrong direction, then </em><em>interrupts</em>*. Navigator navigates for 3 (max 5) minutes and then rotate.</p>
<p>Rotation means that driver now navigates — should know next step, navigator takes a rest, and others of the drives but less than half of them. And after 3 minutes another rotation, and again, …</p>
<p>This rotation style is intense. You have to keep attention all the time, otherwise you’ll have to navigate in couple of minutes, and you’ll have no idea how to navigate (by <strong><em>you</em></strong> is meant the team leader).To stay in shape we do regular breaks for bathroom / coffee, and of course a long break for a lunch. Goals of code view are fulfilled</p>
<p>Sharing knowledge is instant — every team member follows the mental process, and knows why was what done.
Sharing responsibility in my opinion full — I take responsibility for everything that we produce as I can anytime say “I disagree” or “I have a better idea”.
Code structure is agreed by all team members, therefore is consistent and the best team members can do.
Learning… is again instant, and intense. If the navigator is good, they’ll not only call what to do, but also how to do it efficiently. I learn daily better software architecture, better testing strategies, how to use IDE efficiently, … just because navigators know (and share) pieces I’m missing.</p></section><section class="print-page" id="sdeven.70_lip"><p><small><strong>SDEVEN Software Development &amp; Engineering Methodology</strong></small></p>

<h2 id="sdeven.70_lip-preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>This section refers to software licenses and products, how are used and what are good for.</p>
<p>Procedure present what kind of licenses are practiced and generally how a software system becomes a product (or when can be considered product).</p>
<p><small>
This procedure is not mandatory for software development process itself but gives an idea about "what will happen with product for which I did write code". The licensing problem is a commercial and legal one. Its just "for your information", just because many people want to know what becomes their work, and because sometimes is good to know why some decisions are made and wht is the rationality behind them.
</small></p>
<h2 id="sdeven.70_lip-software-licenses-universe">Software licenses universe</h2>
<p>A software license, without any other clause, is about the legal(ity) and right(s) to use the respective product / system.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you can download, copy, install, remove, etc the system, free and in most cases without any payment required. All legal.</p>
<p>But there are two things that are not always free and MUST BE ESTABLISHED BY LICENSE:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A FUNDAMENTAL FACT: The one <strong>you are not the proprietary of code</strong>, you cannot treat it as its your own property, but you can use it <strong><em>JUST for your own and IN YOUR NAME</em></strong>, make safety copies, backup it, restore it, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <strong>cannot use</strong> it without permission (from legal point of view), EVEN THEN SYSTEM DOES NOT ENFORCE ANY RESTRICTION</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.70_lip-software-licenses">Software licenses</h2>
<p>There are 3 kind of license models (types) used by company for software products:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>open licenses</strong> - these are free (there is no cost to pay for them); for these licenses the company still preserve the <em>intellectual property and copyright</em>, just offer for free the rights of use; any other services <em>are not necessarily and default covered by this license</em>, but if you how to do it, you're free to download the software, install and use it without any obligations; however, <strong><em>you cannot sale / resale</em></strong> the system /product as it would be your own property</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>turn key licenses</strong> - these are systems / products made especially for a customer, eventually paid by him and the intellectual property is transferred to the customer; so, after finishing the system, <strong><em>company has no right to sell / resell or use the code or parts of code AS IT WAS TRANSFERRED</em></strong>; however, in most cases, two "evidence" read only CD are made with the code for which the intellectual property is transferred</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>commercial licenses</strong> - these are strictly with payment for usage; quantification of payment is / can be made in various forms, for example number of users, number of computers, number of processors, quantity of memory, and so on; in most cases, the software restrict usage by "forcing" in a way these quantities, of course first thing being the software ability to "count" for them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are many other taxonomies but these are relevant for software development as activity, the others being useful for other domains like product management or legal / lawyers structures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT notice</strong>: If not otherwise specified, open licenses should be accompanied with text: "<strong>This software is a copyright of company Systems (REN CONSULTING SOFT ACTIVITY SRL).</strong>". Text should be put at start of license content as to not alter its original text which is usually published and can be referred AS IS.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sdeven.70_lip-system-vs-product">System vs Product</h2>
<p>For a software there are 3 major "end of cycle": to become a product, to become a system or both.</p>
<p>As <strong>system</strong>, a software should have an installation procedure, which could be just a documentation or other automation software. This procedure should be <em>clear</em>, <em>well defined</em> (ie, deterministic, without ambiguities) and <em>repeatable</em>.</p>
<p>As <strong>product</strong> must have an <em>usage documentation</em> (ie, day by day), an <em>administration documentation</em> (ie, installation, configuration, maintenance), a <em>packaging</em> procedure.</p>
<p>These are from manufacturing point of view, other processes requiring any other issues, for example in marketing a logo would bw required for a product, etc.</p>
<p>This methodology assures that the essential parts of both taxonomies will be covered, at least in raw forms creating the base for future / next refinement levels.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.70_lip-software-products-models">Software products / models</h2>
<p>From this point of view  relevant taxonomies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>by completeness</li>
<li>by code level</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sdeven.70_lip-by-completeness-taxonomy">By completeness taxonomy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>full standalone</strong> - products that contains everything to assure a complete functionality (aka full stack products, or in jargon "with batteries included", all in one, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>modules</strong> - products that assure a single functionality usually useless only itself, but normally used in a large context, combined with other modules; examples: a database JSON transformer, a caching system, a queuing systems, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>frameworks</strong> - products aimed to be used as foundation to build other products over it; examples: python Flask, company CORE, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>interfaces</strong> - products aimed to "stay in front" of other systems / products and therefore assuring different kind of protection, translation, etc; often known as middleware products; examples: data APIs, proxies, guards, data translators, SQL Alchemy, etc</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sdeven.70_lip-by-code-level-taxonomy">By code level taxonomy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>low level / infrastructure</strong> - these are systems that address low level operations, with intensive (ie, directly coded) use of operating system directives; examples: print utilities, file system watchers, system monitors, serializer, de-serializer, en(de)coders, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>mid and high level</strong> - these are systems that do not address directly operating system directives (just in rare cases for usual file operation), usually addressed to business or just to assets inventory (infrastructure systems for example); examples: ERPs, invoice makers, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UI / meta</strong> - these are systems that assure some features for user interface (operations) by using different flavours of (tagging) languages specific to a device (for example VT100 terminals), to a software (for example HTML for browsers); sometimes these systems use "real" languages with empowerment of complex programming languages (for example JavaScript) or just simple "stylers" to assure a better readability (CSS is a good example, Markdown and PostScript are others, etc)</p>

<h2 id="sdeven.75_ccep-preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
<p>The code of ethics and professional conduct outlines the principles that govern decisions and behavior at a company or organization. They give general outlines of how employees should behave, as well as specific guidance for handling issues like harassment, safety, and conflicts of interest.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.75_ccep-a-ethic-code">A. Ethic Code</h2>
<p>A code of ethics is broad, giving employees or members a general idea of what types of behavior and decisions are acceptable and encouraged at a business or organization. A code of conduct is more focused. It defines how employees or members should act in specific situations.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">A1. Be inclusive</p>
<p>We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social and economic class, educational level, color, immigration status, sex, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">A2. Be considerate</p>
<p>We all depend on each other to produce the best work we can as a company. Your decisions will affect clients and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">A3. Be respectful</p>
<p>We won't all agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for disrespectful behavior. We will all experience frustration from time to time, but we cannot allow that frustration become personal attacks. An environment where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive or creative one.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">A4. Choose your words carefully</p>
<p>Always conduct yourself professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Harassment and exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Threats of violence.</li>
<li>Insubordination.</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Sharing sexually explicit or violent material via electronic devices or other means.</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">A5. Don't harass</p>
<p>In general, if someone asks you to stop something, then stop. When we disagree, try to understand why. Differences of opinion and disagreements are mostly unavoidable. What is important is that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">A6. Make differences into strengths</p>
<p>We can find strength in diversity. Different people have different perspectives on issues, and that can be valuable for solving problems or generating new ideas. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that we all make mistakes, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on resolving issues and learning from mistakes.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.75_ccep-b-professional-code">B. Professional Code</h2>
<p>A professional code address those issues related strictly to work environment and derives from necessity of a good, human reasonable, effective, efficient and pleasant working in / with teams.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B1. Work environment</p>
<p>Employees should act with integrity, comply with laws, maintain a professional work environment and comply with company policies. They should treat customers, colleagues, and partners ethically at all times.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B2. Conflicts of interest</p>
<p>A company's reputation depends on the actions and integrity of its employees. It is essential that they avoid relationships and activities that hurt, or appears to hurt, their ability to make objective and fair decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B3. Protecting company assets</p>
<p>Employees should always act to protect company assets, including physical, intellectual, and electronic or digital properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B4. Anti-bribery and corruption</p>
<p>A company's integrity is essential for maintaining trustworthiness and reputation. Employees should always do their work fairly, honestly, and legally.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B5. Attendance and punctuality</p>
<p>Employees are expected to be regular and punctual in attendance. This means being in the office, ready to work, at starting time each day. Absenteeism and tardiness burden other employees and the company.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B6. Absence without notice</p>
<p>Employees who are unable to work due to illness or an accident should notify their supervisor. This allows the company to arrange for coverage of their duties and helps others continue to work in their absence. If an employee does a report for work and the company is not notified of an employee's status for 3 days, it is typically considered a job abandonment.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B7. General harassment and sexual harassment</p>
<p>This company is committed to providing a work environment free of discrimination and unlawful harassment. Actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual’s sex, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or any other legally protected characteristic are not tolerated.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B8. Cell phone use at work</p>
<p>Personal cell phone usage during work hours is discouraged, except in extreme cases such as an emergency.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B9. Dress code</p>
<p>A professional appearance is important when employees work with customers or potential customers. Employees should be well-groomed and dressed appropriately for the business and for their position.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B10. Substance abuse</p>
<p>The manufacture, distribution, possession, sale, or purchase of controlled substances of abuse on company property is prohibited. Being under the influence of illegal drugs, alcohol, or substances of abuse on company property is prohibited. Working while under the influence of prescription drugs that impair performance is prohibited.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B11. Tobacco products</p>
<p>The use of tobacco products on company property, outside of permitted areas, is specifically prohibited.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">B12. Internet use at work</p>
<p>Employees may use the Internet when appropriate to access information needed to conduct a business company business. Use of the Internet must not disrupt or injure the company computer network. Use of the Internet must not interfere with an employee's productivity.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sdeven.75_ccep-c-legal-issues">C. Legal issues</h2>
<p>Legal issues refer to those aspects where a software product / system interfere with legal aspects. From developer point of view these are very much related to personal information regarding end users of system and their potential comfortably related to personal data of confidential nature.</p>
<p>Other legal aspects are subject of a specialised department of company.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">C1. Potential confidential data</p>
<ul>
<li>identification official codes, by official meaning they are subject of any personal official document</li>
<li>personal adress of residence</li>
<li>personal phone number</li>
<li>personal email</li>
<li>any personal banking information</li>
<li>passwords and user names / id-s</li>
<li>name of family members</li>
<li>other sensitive and personal data, like incomes, revenues, expenses, religious data, color (skin, hair, etc), dressing, etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">C2. How to avoid potential problems</p>
<p>First of all it is important to keep in mind that for violating some legal issues, THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR DID IT, even if the reason was a good intention... The law is applicable as is. So <em>DO NOT SUPPOSE ANYTHING</em>, and better is <strong>to ask if you're not sure</strong> and ready to assume all consequences.</p>
<p>So, here you'll find some simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not write any out of specifications code, ie, "hidden code"</li>
<li>do not collect any personal data (see previous section) without user consent</li>
<li>store any personal data using different encryption mechanisms; if not specified in system design then use hashing</li>

<h2 id="sdeven.80_copri-preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
<p>This section is about terminology and naming standards and conventions used in development process and code.</p>
<p>The company try to keep aligned to international practiced and most used terms &amp; conventions and adopts standard changes "on the fly" as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Is necessary that people that are working in software structures (departments) of company to <em>keep aligned</em> with terms and conventions in order to have <strong>A COMMON LANGUAGE AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THINGS</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea is that when is needed to write things that will be used by someone else in the other process steps or in the future after a while (ie, there are more that one people involved), it is important that <strong>shared things to be recognized</strong> at destination as they was thought at origin by those team that produced them.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.80_copri-files">Files</h2>
<ul>
<li>files whose names start with <code>xxx</code> (case is not important) are (and will be) considered marked for a <strong><em>future deletion or discontinuing</em></strong>'</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition question">
<p class="admonition-title">why don't delete them directly</p>
<ul>
<li>this method allows to "remember" to delete them latter but to still keep the information available a while to assure an acceptable and as smooth change management (and to give time for a possible return to the previous situation)</li>
<li>also when view list of files in alphabetically order, these files appear grouped near the end (or beginning)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>files whose names start  with <code>_WIP</code> or <code>WIP</code> (normally case doesn't matter but should be a sign to pay more attention) are known (announced) as <strong><em>being in work and not in a stable state</em></strong>, so they should be treated more carefully when need to use them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other "traditional" conventions should be respected and treated in consequence; the most of them comes from <code>Linux</code> systems, for example files beginning with dot (<code>.</code>) are hidden (for normal users), backup files have extension <code>.bck</code>, files with extension <code>.tmp</code> are temporary and subject to be deleted (by users or operating system) without notice, and so on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the characters <code>-</code> (dash) and <code></code> (space) will be avoided as much as possible in file names (ie, in different programs should be source of errors by confusing with arithmetic minus operator) and replaced with <code>_</code> (underscore); if this is not possible, A WARNING must be stated inside the file content or in a respetive component README file</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.80_copri-calendar-dates">Calendar dates</h2>
<p>These should respect the convention as they will be written as <code>YYYYMMDD</code> or <code>YYMMDD</code>, because by doing so will assure a right ordering "by date" in about all situations (just by using the operating system standard sorting procedures and not requiring some special order methods); the year could be only from 2 characters if there is no doubt regarding the year (the standard conventions stated by <em>SQL ANSI</em> are very clear and self explanatory)</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.80_copri-datastores">Datastores</h2>
<p>The preferred datastore for code is the repository.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are cases when <em>other type of stores are required</em>. Generally these stores are required in development process (stores for other processes are not subject if this methodology) and specific to project. They can be permanent (as stores where kits resides or stores for sales materials) or temporary allocated for project.</p>
<p>In any cases the <code>dev infrastructure admin</code> should be contacted.</p>
<p>Normally these stores will be allocated from file server pools, which means that will act as "simple shared drives" (without any notice). If there are some other protocols required, such as access by <code>http</code>, <code>https</code>, <code>rsync</code> and so on, <em>these issues must be notified</em>.</p>
<p>Also you should always expect that for such stores there are some limitations such as maximum capacity allowed, number of files, lifetime of files, file foemats allowed, etc. If this could be issues or you concern about them, please ASK and do not make other assumptions.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.80_copri-in-code-names-identifiers">"In code" names &amp; identifiers</h2>
<p>These issues should follow the programming language standards (as <code>PEP</code> for <code>Python</code>) or best practices in case there are no stated standards. A <em>linter</em> and / or code formatter should be used like <code>Blake</code> for <code>Python</code>, but better is to <em>ASK</em> the team leader or project technical manager and NOT TO USE your own standards by supposing they are good and should be used (if this is the case, please discuss this with technical stuff before putting it in practice).</p>
<p>Some of recommended practices in any cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>always mark protected or private attributes with underscore character in front of their names, regardless the programming language used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>always comment the code; as frequently as better; do not worry about readability or other concerns; somebody will take care to ask for cleaning if seems to be too much "spam"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use UPPER CASE for identifiers used or intended to use as constants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comment the functions or class methods with a large comment block and specify at least: a description of max 2 lines, the argument types and what are good for, the returns type and when is happening</p>
</li>

<h2 id="sdeven.90_renblu-preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>This section is about whole methodology <strong>phases</strong>, <strong>processes</strong>, <strong>steps</strong>, their <em>codes</em>, all over a cheat sheet / blueprint of "the whole".</p>
<p>The phases are important as <strong>codes</strong> (on <em>documents</em> for example) and as name and content for a better understanding of process. They can also be used (and this is recommended) <em>as directory / file names</em> for a common understanding (at least 8<em>30-DEV</em> and <em>880-RLSE</em>) but when use them in file system (file or directory names) is important to pay attention to case (<strong>lower ase is accepted</strong>) and the character <code>-</code> (dash) and space (<strong>underscore <code>_</code> is accepted</strong>).</p>
<p>This methodology, being applicable to all software development projects, not all sections are applicable in all cases, so in <a href="#appendix_b_dsgn_content_index">design template document - md</a> will be CLEAR specified for each section if it is REQUIRED or OPTIONAL.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.90_renblu-blueprint-typologies">Blueprint / typologies</h2>
<p>Basically the <strong>RENware SDEVEN)</strong> (aka <em>SDEVEN</em>) methodology name is an acronym of <em>Software Development &amp; ENgineering</em> and is adapted to company <em>practices</em>, <em>software styles</em>, types of software in portfolio and scope  and follows a classic <em>waterfall</em> inspired pattern but which can (and is) be used as an evolutionary model with sprints inspired from Agile methodology.</p>
<p>There are classic phases up to release a product followed by maintenance and current operations phases post release. After a release, the methodology allows returns to any of the first 6 phases for new features / versions releases, the MAIN OBJECTIVE being a higher coherency, traceability and ability to move project from a team to another team with minimum overheard due to project adoption.</p>
<p>In this document processes deliverables are summary described keeping a level that facilitate the understanding of principles of methodology. For more details is recommended to consult the appendix referred (see references section).</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.90_renblu-roles-responsibilities">Roles &amp; responsibilities</h2>
<p>For each "final" (ie, leaf) process, the basic required roles was specified. Roles are abbreviated as described in <em>10.ADM</em> section. Also a super generic role was used in places where more and different specific roles should be used depending on project context, size and complexity.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.90_renblu-phase-100-ana-analysis">Phase 100-ANA Analysis</h2>
<p>This phase is the stage where the system requirements are collected and processed (engineered) to a more structured form in order to be more usable in system / product elaboration process.</p>
<p>Traditionally the phase start from system requirements which are (re)structured in primary designs (aka high level design) at a level which allows for system blueprint, objectives, structure and functions.</p>
<p>Also, here are produced the sales kits which will be used by marketing and sales structures in their work to market and sale the system / product.</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.90_renblu-110-sre-system-requirements">110-SRE System Requirements</h3>
<p>These are the requirements as collected (elicitation) and categorized by relevant taxonomies. As mandatory taxonomies are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>functional</strong> types: functional, implementation issues, performance issues, user interaction issues, interfacing issues, standards compliance</li>
<li><strong>urgency and importance</strong> types following MoSCoW paradigm - must, should, could, would</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sdeven.90_renblu-120-cpts-system-concepts">120-CPTS System Concepts</h3>
<p>This is what is called usually <em>High Level Design</em> but it means more than it. This deliverable should contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the basic system concepts as business specific terminology</li>
<li>a high level architecture indicating at least the basic functional components of the system (logical architecture)</li>
<li>the system universe as other business components which interact with the system and very shortly what kind of information is exchanged in interaction process </li>
<li>what are the applicable standards and why are they important</li>
<li>what are the main security issues and how can be avoided</li>
<li>types / models of user interfaces intended to be implemented</li>
<li>which logical components are back ends, front ends, communication, interfaces</li>

<p>The "things" required to sales structures should be  put under this code, eventually with detailed documents and codes following a class notation (with dot character). The most common things are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a system blueprint that can be used in presentations</li>
<li>a system logical architecture that can be used in presentations</li>
<li>some key differentiators that can be used in offers and bids</li>
<li>various pro/con-s analysis ref other market similar products</li>
<li>a list of system requirements that it satisfy (and usual responses) usable in bidding process</li>
<li>a list of system standards that it is complaint to (and usual responses) usable in bidding process</li>
<li>some known "frequently asked questions" and the answers to them</li>
</ul>
<p><em>None of these represent new information</em>. All information os to be found in the other documents just it is (re)structured in other way in which is more useful to sales personnel.</p>

<h3 id="sdeven.90_renblu-190-sktd-sketches-technical-diagrams">190-SKTD Sketches &amp; Technical Diagrams</h3>
<p>These are different drawings of system parts. They are (should be) separated because can be useful (as raw images) in other places / processes such as presentations, UI design, branding, etc.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.90_renblu-phase-800-swd-software-development">Phase 800-SWD Software Development</h2>
<p>This phase covers the software realization process but from an engineering point of view, meaning not only code and programs writing, but also the design, testing and release processes, Aim is to make a <strong>SYSTEM PRODUCT</strong>, usable and maintainable both by the beneficiary and RENware as the producer. Another important issue is related to capability of the system to be "migrated" to other team members with as less overhead effort as possible.</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.90_renblu-810-dsgn-system-design">810-DSGN System Design</h3>
<p>This is the main technical detailed document of the system. It is the starting point for any developer that join the project snd its job require to understand the system.</p>

<h3 id="sdeven.90_renblu-820-syint-system-internals">820-SYINT System Internals</h3>
<p>This is nothing else that low level design too, but is seen as a <em>dedicated chapter or appendix</em> of 810-DSGN and refers technical documents (that often are read singularly, for example a dev needs to review only some states of an object) such as system states, sequence diagrams, etc, documents that by default are classified and should not get out of project without special approvals.</p>

<p>This "contains / is" the system as it is on repository system. Practical is the local repository image. It clearly contains all things / codes / programs / scripts needed for system to work, bur it can contain (and it is strongly recommended) the system other documentation being it technical or end user manuals. </p>
<p>The only thing that must be said is regarding documentation. Therefore the <em>technical one</em> <em>must be in text formats</em> (markdown is preferred) and <em>other documents</em> should be also in <em>text format as much as possible</em>. Binary formats should be strongly avoided (are not "<code>diff</code>-able") but in "no other option" cases, the repository administrator must be informed about binary files to action in consequence. As other suggested options to binary documents would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>use markdown extensions like <code>mermaid</code> for "graphical" things / diagrams,</li>
<li>store them as xml format,</li>
<li>store them as pdf format,</li>
<li>use "open text formats", etc.</li>

<h3 id="sdeven.90_renblu-840-test-system-testing">840-TEST System Testing</h3>
<p>The things that are mandatory here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>testing plan</strong>: what to test (<em>REQUIRED</em>), when to tets, by who</li>
<li><strong>test cases</strong> - that represent for each test required:</li>
<li>the exact expected steps to be done with a number / code to be easily referred in other places</li>
<li>the expected result to be obtained by doing previous steps (often is useful to indicated an acceptable tolerance, especially when are talking about numbers or times)</li>
<li>the system reported messages (if there are) and results, preferably with associated print screens</li>
<li>a <strong>testing report</strong> that summarize the results of testing process: number of severe / critical bugs, number of acceptable errors (as solvable by work around), recommendations to improve, documentation non conformities, time spent for testing, automation tools used, required and recommended.</li>

<h3 id="sdeven.90_renblu-880-rlse-system-releases">880-RLSE System Releases</h3>
<p>This refers to releasing process regardless of released version qualifier (not only to <em>release versions</em>) but to any kind of version being it an alpha or a beta or a previewer, etc.</p>
<p>Any release should pass a test process which is done by developer itself as first test (<strong>alpha test</strong>). No promote to higher version qualifiers is allowed if alpha tests did not pass or was bypassed (skipped).</p>
<p>After alpha test can be created a branch for testers team or a tag (that will be used latter for a test branch creation).</p>
<p>Any tag will be kept at least for minimum 4 tags after it but no more than 20 tags after. These min and max can be modified if project require other limits.</p>
<p>Tags will be saved also on an external backup (in project history).</p>
<p>Releasing a version must be documented accordingly in project <em>CHANGELOG</em> and if project require, a <em>release note</em> should be issued. Both must be written with enough care to text explanations and having in mind that will be used latter by other persons in writing different product documents and marketing materials.</p>

<h2 id="sdeven.90_renblu-phase-900-ops-operations">Phase 900-OPS Operations</h2>
<p>This phase is about maintaining the system after a release. In fact is about <strong><em>maintaining a release</em></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.90_renblu-few-words-about-software-maintenance">Few words about software maintenance</h3>
<p>The maintenance is probably the hard thing about a software. Software maintainability is the most important issue for any software company that develop its own software as portfolio product.</p>
<p>Along decades there was more and more improvements in software development process, probably the biggest step being made when <em>software development was considered an ENGINEERING discipline</em> with all things that engineering means. But the biggest issue remained the <em>measurement process</em>.</p>
<p>From maintenance point of view a released version must be kept "alive" a period of time. That alive is mostly generated by the fact that software being an intangible product, so hard to measure, always could be some astigmatic functionalities, ie non conform ones, aka bugs, that should be remediate after release. Different methods to categorize and measure these non conformities was developed in time. <strong>Now the most accepted "definition" for a "bug" is: a(ny) thing that works otherwise that is written in product documentation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="sdeven.90_renblu-910-mnt-system-maintenance">910-MNT System Maintenance</h3>
<p>These are current operations related to modifications /changes that must be made to a released version.</p>
<p>The important things are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to maintain an acceptable coherence during modifications in order to avoid <strong><em>side effects</em></strong></li>
<li>to make changes in a way to not be repeated after some time, ie to not make / solve the same issue more than once in time! </li>
<li>to present an interface to users that is able to collect and centralize issues (aka support line / center)</li>

<p>This section is about projects confidentiality with particular aspects to software development.</p>
<h2 id="sdeven.95_cocl-overview-of-classification-in-renware-company">Overview of classification in RENware company</h2>
<p>In <strong>RENware</strong> company, classification follows the "standard" practices, just applied in almost all of cases to projects level (there could be exceptions but these are announced specially). So, the are the following levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>UNCLASSIFIED</em></strong> projects - these are public projects; they are not marked</li>
<li><strong><em>STANDARD</em></strong> projects - these are the most projects and classification applies IN PROJECT SCOPE; they are marked as <strong><code>RESTRICTED. ONLY FOR PROJECT INTERNAL USE</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>CONFIDENTIAL</em></strong> projects (aka TOP projects) - these are usually company internal projects, such as research projects; they are marked as <strong><code>CONFIDENTIAL. ONLY FOR PROJECT INTERNAL USE</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>STRICT CONFIDENTIAL</em></strong> projects - these are projects <strong><code>reserved</code></strong> or <strong><code>ONLY RENware top management</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdeven.95_cocl-software-development-perspective">Software development perspective</h2>
<p>Ref to this point of view, <em>ALL PROJECTS THAT BELONGS IN A WAY TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</em> (ie, specific as software development or just  have parts which involves software development) are as <em>default</em> at <strong>STANDARD</strong> level of classification. This means that for these projects, even if they are not marked, the rules of <strong><code>RESTRICTED. ONLY FOR PROJECT INTERNAL USE</code></strong> must be <em>AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED</em>.</p>
<p>No person (does not matter if is employee or freelancer or other third party) is (will be) allowed to work with this kind of projects IF NOT has signed an agreement regarding to:</p>
<ul>
<li>information "manipulation" inside and outside of project</li>
<li>code of conduct, part ref to legal issues</li>
</ul>
<p>All project documents are by <em>default</em> to <strong>RESTRICTED</strong> level. The responsibility to approve exceptions belongs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>for all 100, 800 and 900 documents to <em>Project Manager</em></li>
<li>by exception, for <em>130-SKIT</em> documents, to <em>Product Manager</em></li>

<h2 id="appendix_a_semantic_versioning-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MAJOR</strong> version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
<li><strong>MINOR</strong> version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and</li>
<li><strong>PATCH</strong> version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata (qualifiers) are available as extensions to the <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> format.</p>
<h2 id="appendix_a_semantic_versioning-introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the world of software management there exists a dreaded place called “dependency hell.” The bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this pit of despair.</p>
<p>In systems with many dependencies, releasing new package versions can quickly become a nightmare. If the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable). Dependency hell is where you are when version lock and/or version promiscuity prevent you from easily and safely moving your project forward.</p>
<p>As a solution to this problem, I propose a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existing widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software. For this system to work, you first need to declare a public API. This may consist of documentation or be enforced by the code itself. Regardless, it is important that this API be clear and precise. Once you identify your public API, you communicate changes to it with specific increments to your version number. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes increment the major version.</p>
<p>I call this system “Semantic Versioning.” Under this scheme, version numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next.</p>
<h2 id="appendix_a_semantic_versioning-semantic-versioning-specification-semver">Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)</h2>
<p><em>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</em></p>
<p>Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a <strong>public API</strong>. This API could be declared in the code itself or exist strictly in documentation. However it is done, it SHOULD be precise and comprehensive.</p>
<p>A <strong>normal version</strong> number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -&gt; 1.10.0 -&gt; 1.11.0.</p>
<p>Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.</p>
<p><strong>Major version</strong> zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.</p>
<p>Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it changes.</p>
<p><strong>Patch version</strong> Z (x.y.Z | x &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Minor version</strong> Y (x.Y.z | x &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.</p>
<p><strong>Major version</strong> X (X.y.z | X &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY also include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor version MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.</p>
<p>A <strong>pre-release version</strong> MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92, 1.0.0-x-y-z.–.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata MUST be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85, 1.0.0+21AF26D3—-117B344092BD.</p>
<h2 id="appendix_a_semantic_versioning-precedence">Precedence</h2>
<p>Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered.</p>
<p>Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not figure into precedence).</p>
<p>Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: 1.0.0 &lt; 2.0.0 &lt; 2.1.0 &lt; 2.1.1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: 1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and patch version MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier from left to right until a difference is found as follows:</p>
<p>Identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically.</p>
<p>Identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort order.</p>
<p>Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers.</p>
<p>A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: 1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0-alpha.1 &lt; 1.0.0-alpha.beta &lt; 1.0.0-beta &lt; 1.0.0-beta.2 &lt; 1.0.0-beta.11 &lt; 1.0.0-rc.1 &lt; 1.0.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="appendix_a_semantic_versioning-why-use-semantic-versioning">Why Use Semantic Versioning?</h2>
<p>This is not a new or revolutionary idea. In fact, you probably do something close to this already. The problem is that “close” isn’t good enough. Without compliance to some sort of formal specification, version numbers are essentially useless for dependency management. By giving a name and clear definition to the above ideas, it becomes easy to communicate your intentions to the users of your software. Once these intentions are clear, flexible (but not too flexible) dependency specifications can finally be made.</p>
<p>A simple example will demonstrate how Semantic Versioning can make dependency hell a thing of the past. Consider a library called “Firetruck.” It requires a Semantically Versioned package named “Ladder.” At the time that Firetruck is created, Ladder is at version 3.1.0. Since Firetruck uses some functionality that was first introduced in 3.1.0, you can safely specify the Ladder dependency as greater than or equal to 3.1.0 but less than 4.0.0. Now, when Ladder version 3.1.1 and 3.2.0 become available, you can release them to your package management system and know that they will be compatible with existing dependent software.</p>
<p>As a responsible developer you will, of course, want to verify that any package upgrades function as advertised. The real world is a messy place; there’s nothing we can do about that but be vigilant. What you can do is let Semantic Versioning provide you with a sane way to release and upgrade packages without having to roll new versions of dependent packages, saving you time and hassle.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds desirable, all you need to do to start using Semantic Versioning is to declare that you are doing so and then follow the rules. Link to this website from your README so others know the rules and can benefit from them.</p>
<h2 id="appendix_a_semantic_versioning-faq">FAQ</h2>
<p>How should I deal with revisions in the 0.y.z initial development phase?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at 0.1.0 and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do I know when to release 1.0.0?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you’re worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Major version zero is all about rapid development. If you’re changing the API every day you should either still be in version 0.y.z or on a separate development branch working on the next major version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If even the tiniest backwards incompatible changes to the public API require a major version bump, won’t I end up at version 42.0.0 very rapidly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a question of responsible development and foresight. Incompatible changes should not be introduced lightly to software that has a lot of dependent code. The cost that must be incurred to upgrade can be significant. Having to bump major versions to release incompatible changes means you’ll think through the impact of your changes, and evaluate the cost/benefit ratio involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Documenting the entire public API is too much work!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is your responsibility as a professional developer to properly document software that is intended for use by others. Managing software complexity is a hugely important part of keeping a project efficient, and that’s hard to do if nobody knows how to use your software, or what methods are safe to call. In the long run, Semantic Versioning, and the insistence on a well defined public API can keep everyone and everything running smoothly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do I do if I accidentally release a backwards incompatible change as a minor version?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As soon as you realize that you’ve broken the Semantic Versioning spec, fix the problem and release a new minor version that corrects the problem and restores backwards compatibility. Even under this circumstance, it is unacceptable to modify versioned releases. If it’s appropriate, document the offending version and inform your users of the problem so that they are aware of the offending version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What should I do if I update my own dependencies without changing the public API?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That would be considered compatible since it does not affect the public API. Software that explicitly depends on the same dependencies as your package should have their own dependency specifications and the author will notice any conflicts. Determining whether the change is a patch level or minor level modification depends on whether you updated your dependencies in order to fix a bug or introduce new functionality. I would usually expect additional code for the latter instance, in which case it’s obviously a minor level increment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if I inadvertently alter the public API in a way that is not compliant with the version number change (i.e. the code incorrectly introduces a major breaking change in a patch release)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use your best judgment. If you have a huge audience that will be drastically impacted by changing the behavior back to what the public API intended, then it may be best to perform a major version release, even though the fix could strictly be considered a patch release. Remember, Semantic Versioning is all about conveying meaning by how the version number changes. If these changes are important to your users, use the version number to inform them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How should I handle deprecating functionality?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deprecating existing functionality is a normal part of software development and is often required to make forward progress. When you deprecate part of your public API, you should do two things: (1) update your documentation to let users know about the change, (2) issue a new minor release with the deprecation in place. Before you completely remove the functionality in a new major release there should be at least one minor release that contains the deprecation so that users can smoothly transition to the new API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does <strong>SemVer</strong> have a size limit on the version string?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, but use good judgment. A 255 character version string is probably overkill, for example. Also, specific systems may impose their own limits on the size of the string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is “v1.2.3” a semantic version?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, “v1.2.3” is not a semantic version. However, prefixing a semantic version with a “v” is a common way (in English) to indicate it is a version number. Abbreviating “version” as “v” is often seen with version control. Example: git tag v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3", in which case “v1.2.3” is a tag name and the semantic version is “1.2.3”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there a suggested regular expression (RegEx) to check a SemVer string?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two. One with named groups for those systems that support them (PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, i.e. Perl, PHP and R, Python and Go).</p>
<p><a href="https://regex101.com/r/Ly7O1x/3/">See: </a></p>
<p>And one with numbered capture groups instead (so cg1 = major, cg2 = minor, cg3 = patch, cg4 = prerelease and cg5 = buildmetadata) that is compatible with ECMA Script (JavaScript), PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, i.e. Perl, PHP and R), Python and Go.</p>

<p>Here you'll find a recommended structure of 810-DSGN document containing ALL information that it can contain.</p>
<p>This structure is enough /comprehensive for most of the projects but it can bw extended in all situations where this brings more recant aspects in a project. </p>
<h3 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-structure-of-document">Structure of document</h3>
<p>It follows the methodology phases as described in RENBLU document. For each section there is specified if is: MANDATORY, OPTIONAL or RECOMMENDED. Also, should be noted that those sections which have "a full code" (not just a simple number) are intended to be released as separated documents and here make reference to them.</p>
<h3 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-structure-content-of-deliverable">Structure &amp; content of deliverable</h3>
<p>Its important to say that some sections are <strong>mandatory</strong> (and marked accordingly) and should <strong>exists AS IS in all cases</strong>, regardless other information or the same but in other structure presented.</p>

<p>Here are the requirements in most raw form, meaning "exactly as collected". It seems that sometimes is optional but:</p>

<li>if this is a new version with just some issues, too few and clear - even so, after some time should be not SO CLEAR as it was...</li>
</ul>
<p>If section a better approach is to make some short notes following “MoSCoW" taxonomy, if possible or if no then let some margins for future hand wrote annotations for a reviewer.</p>
<h3 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-120-cpts-system-concepts-required-in-almost-all-cases">120-CPTS System Concepts (REQUIRED in almost all cases)</h3>
<p>Here should be at least a detailed description

<p>This information will be BASIS for a future system design.</p>
<p>When is not necessary? So, in cases when it already exists and system intended modifications are nor of nature to alter these concepts.</p>

<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-13001-product-datasheet-required-always">130.01 Product Datasheet (REQUIRED always)</h4>
<p>The datasheet is an element that describe the product itself, mostly from technical point of view. It is very common as engineering practice and its structure is not "something standard" but in practice the following information should appear here:</p>
<ul>
<li>what the product is good for</li>
<li>technical specifications, mainly the standards which are compliant</li>
<li>interfaces (if are), shortly and technically how to use them</li>
<li>the product ecosystem: ie if there are more editions available, trainings available, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically a datasheet contains all that is considered useful for a person "at first look". Then, if really interested, will search for other detailed documents. This document is required being considered "<em>one of the first contacts with customer</em>". Many sites (search engines) are looking for <code>motors</code> section in HTML and what is considered as datasheet is one of the first elements to be displayed.</p>
<p>There are many examples (different forms and kind of products) of this document for RENNware products, not being a standard form (but changes with market trends) so here will not be included one.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-13002-product-overview-required-if-not-present-in-datasheet">130.02 Product Overview (REQUIRED if not present in <em>Datasheet</em>)</h4>
<p>This section is mandatory if it is not present in datasheet (see previous section) and it should contain exactly what its name say, an overview of system / product. Many companies name this document as "flyer", "products brochure", and so on, but mainly is an overview of product ref <em>what is good for</em>.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-13003-spin-documents-optional">130.03 SPIN documents (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>This section is absolutely optional as not any developer knows what it is. It contains (if present) useful information for sales department to build cheat sheets ref problems that could be addressed at a customer in business context of this product.</p>
<p>Just for as curiosity, SPIN is a sales technique and the acronym is derived from Situation, Problems, Increase (problems) and Needs.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-13004-licensing-editions-pricing-optional">130.04 Licensing Editions &amp; Pricing (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>This section is optional if the system is "one edition - one license" model.</p>
<p>If there are more options for licensing or the product has been elaborated with "more editions in mind", so these should be written here as for sales / product manager references.</p>
<p>There is no need for elaborated or "sophisticated" text / content. Just enumerated options, what exactly would be the metric for licensing and some information useful to have an ideea of how could be established a price (if there are known). The document will be reviewed and (re)written by somebody else from product management area.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-13005-service-training-programmes-optional-as-recommended">130.05 Service &amp; Training Programmes (OPTIONAL as RECOMMENDED)</h4>
<p>This section should be present in all cases as it describe what other services (installation, configuring, migration, etc) and training programs are available and how can be accessed / requested.</p>
<p>As in the licensing section, there is no need for "sophisticated" text. Anybody else would process latter this document but need to understand some basics and to have a future reference where to "come back" to check for missing ideas or useful things.</p>
<h3 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-190-sktd-sketches-technical-diagrams-optional">190-SKTD Sketches &amp; Technical Diagrams (OPTIONAL)</h3>
<p>This section(s) contains the diagrams and pictures used in other parts in their raw form un order to be latter easily converted in other formats needed.</p>
<!-- -#NOTE start of BIG section -->
<h2 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-800-swd-software-development">800-SWD Software Development</h2>
<h3 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-810-dsgn-system-design">810-DSGN System Design</h3>
<p>The system design document is a collection of more chapters / sections / volumes, and these can be outlined in one or more documents, function of information volume. In that case please keep the convention of file names in order that other people to "recognize" a document first by its name.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81000-overview-update-of-13002-required">810.00 Overview - update of <em>130.02</em> (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>Updates the overview of the system (<em><code>130.02</code></em> document). This update is "how things are seen by <em>system designer</em>". Anyway at least a reference should be made and a summary of them will bring "more clarity" for software development.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81001-system-requirements-update-of-110-sre-optional">810.01 System Requirements - update of <em>110-SRE</em> (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>This is the nature to make things more clear for system development by aligning (mapping) technical taxonomies to existing business ones.</p>
<p>Essentially this is an update of <em><code>110-SRE</code></em> document ref its requirements specification part "as seen by system designer".</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81002-system-landscape-required">810.02 System Landscape (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>The system landscape is anything else that different kinds of architectures, such as logical, functional, physical, interfaces, etc. Some of them are "the same thing" in most cases, but there are situations when small subtle information makes difference.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to depict the whole system in smaller parts un order to be manageable from all points of view.</p>
<p>Another important aspect is that the <strong>architectures must be coherent between them</strong>. They represent the same system from different perspectives and clearly <strong>must exists a map between them</strong>, not necessarily 1 to 1 (it would be impossible) but in any cardinality it must be and <strong>must be a deterministic one</strong>.</p>
<p>As architectures, at least a <strong>logical</strong> one should be, describing those logical components and their relationships. </p>
<p>Must be clear that all next sections will be <em>details</em> of the landscape and to avoid complexity you should <strong>focus here on WHAT</strong> system has to do and NOT on how system will do. For "how" there are next sections and references to them are clearly useful.</p>
<p>As architectures here are mentioned the most used and common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>logical</em> architecture - this depict the system logic for its coherent functionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>functional</em> architecture - in almost cases is just a breakdown of system functionalities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>physical</em> architecture - describe the physical environment on which the components will operate (machines, devices, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>interfaces</em> - describe those system interfaces designed to be used by various other systems to communicate with this one</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Important things in architectures design:</p>
<ul>
<li>start with an "overall" picture; this contains just the system as bubble and all its external environment, meaning data (generally named messages at this level)</li>
<li>do not concentrate at first level for what is / will be inside the "system bubble", just on its external environment</li>
<li><em>name</em> each message outlined in system environment; associate some codes with these names to assure that is unique</li>
<li>use a future dot (<code>.</code>) scheme for hierarchy and do not concentrate on ordering on messages here - there should be no relevant ordering at this level</li>
<li>give a <em>direction</em> to these messages; direction should be as "seen" from system perspective and can be: IN, OUT, BIDIRECTIONAL</li>
<li>each message should be triggered by "something" and at this level is important to mark the triggers; these could be: an event, an user action / manual, another system automate action, etc</li>
<li>do not mix messages with their triggers; latter you will need to have them as  separate</li>
<li>when ready (must establish a "ready", latter you can and will come back and review these) <strong>break the system bubble</strong> in smaller parts / bubbles and repeat the same schema with messages</li>
<li>at this level consider any sub-bubble as an independent system itself and treat it like did for first system bubble</li>
<li>the whole process should be repeated for each new bubble</li>
<li>when to stop with breaking down? the most frequent signal is when <strong>you need to talk about how not only about WHAT</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81003-system-data-objects-required">810.03 System Data &amp; Objects (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>For data objects there are more useful levels and taxonomies ref how and what to describe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>conceptual schema</strong> - this level focus on list (inventory) of objects and their relationships. <strong>THIS IS THE LEVEL WHERE YOU MUST START</strong>. this model is. mostly known as "conceptual ER diagram" </li>
<li><strong>behavioral schema</strong> - this model focus on how data <em>react</em> at various events / triggers and how it transform depending on context</li>
</ul>
<p>From other point of view (taxonomy) there could be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>physical schema</strong> - that describe data from database server (whatever it would be) perspective; the biggest problem with this is the <em>model dependency of database server</em>; at this moment and in most cases we do not want to create <em>so hard</em> dependencies such a database server - our intention is to let these aspects as "large / open" as possible but continuing development</li>
<li><strong>ORM schemes</strong> - this kind of schemas describe data as <em>classes</em> (in their true sense); <strong><em>this is the most preferred model</em></strong> as being in almost cases agnostic to database server (but in a way depends of programming language); it should be able to model both the <em>conceptual</em> and <em>behavioral</em> aspects of data (lifecycle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some guidelines in designing system data (objects):</p>
<ul>
<li>use underscore (<code>_</code>) to prefix those attributes that are not necessarily / directly related to business; in most languages, variables beginning with <code>_</code> are private or protected by default</li>
<li>prefix names with <code>_pk</code> for primary keys; this is preferred instead of <code>id</code> which could create unwanted dependencies being so large practiced</li>
<li>prefix names with <code>_fk</code> for foreign keys; keep a "clean" name for business relations instead (usable only in ORM schemas)</li>
<li>keep a largely supported, best know and with enough language libraries available ORM; <strong><em>SQLAlchemy</em></strong> is the most preferred, but could be others except those that limit usability strictly to one language and / or, directly / indirectly to one operating system for a real production deployment (which must be "something" stable and robust enough by definition)</li>
<li>think relatively agnostic ref database server nature (SQL or noSQL); using ORMs you should be able to work with JSON formats in all cases without too much issues</li>
<li>let <em>detailed diagrams</em> as much as possible for <em><code>820-SINT System Internals</code></em> document where are specialized sections for these; the other people expect find them there not here</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81004-system-ui-optional-recommended">810.04 System UI (OPTIONAL RECOMMENDED)</h4>
<p>Things here should be "obviously", but here are some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep a "clean" Ui interface, with simple and usual widgets</li>
<li>be clear with user information ref widgets - for example for a "Browse..." button it should be clear what files are visible: from its local system or from server...</li>
<li>think for usage of simple template frameworks, use a simple one (like <em>Bootstrap</em> or <em>UI Kit</em>) and try to avoid as much as possible to mix them, or assure they have good enough disseminated properties in order to be mixed (for example <em>UI Kit)</em></li>
<li>use any kind of mockups you think give enough clarity for (the other) developers in coding <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, etc sections</li>
<li>be <em>EXPLICITLY</em> in specifying all things; avoid to suppose that anyone should know defaults for a framework; even in this case make enough references and put links where defaults ca be found</li>
<li>use (wherever is applicable) hierarchical diagrams to show "things"; they offer more "visibility" for auditors</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81005a-system-processes-required">810.05a System Processes (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>Here you must define the system processes and functionalities.</p>
<p>Start with a functionalities list. Organize it hierarchically having in mind a business criteria relevant for system informational domain. As a good check, any functionality is outlined here should be assured by at least one component from logical / functional architecture. So a <em>compliance matrix "functionality by component"</em> will be clearly very helpful. If there are functionalities assured by more than 1 logical component, instead a simple "x" in matrix cells, use more symbols, for example "s" for start here, "e" for ends here, "n" for notification, etc. DO NOT FORGET TO ANNOTATE MATRIX WITH A <strong>LEGEND</strong>. Even if seems that abbreviations are / should be very clear, there is not necessarily true. Remember basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not be IMPLICIT, but EXPLICIT.</li>
<li>Do not suppose anything; do not make assumptions</li>
</ul>
<p>When the functionalities list is ready or for those which are clear, a (one for start) process should be outlined for it. </p>
<p>The processes are "coming" not only directly from functionalities but can be derived from other "places". Even so, these places will be addressed from some functionalities, maybe not necessarily as first level but from a functionality.</p>
<p>This functionality is not necessarily to be one directly "visible" for end users.</p>
<p>So, after outlining a process iy should be "decorated" with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a code and a human understandable name</li>
<li>a description of what will do this process (ie what is good for)</li>
<li>a list of what data will be required in this process</li>
<li>the results will produce</li>
</ul>
<p>Identically, all things should be <strong>coherent and consistent</strong>. Some compliance matrices up to architecture will be a very good check for designer but for developer also.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81005b-application-software-organization-optional">810.05b Application Software Organization (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>Here are 2 aspects (at least) tha need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>toolstack used / proposed to be used</li>
<li>application structure / organization</li>
</ul>
<p>From the <strong><em>Toolstack</em></strong> perspective there must be said:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programming languages</li>
<li>scripting languages</li>
<li>operating systems required compatibility</li>
<li>frameworks and libraries proposed</li>
</ul>
<p>From the <strong><em>Application Structure / Organization</em></strong> perspective it is important:</p>
<ul>
<li>to design a simple directory structure; make use as much as possible of known practices, for example anybody will expect that in a directory named <code>doc</code> to find out some documentation</li>
<li>for data as physical one, if applicable (not only / necessarily database files, even JSON files for example) think a <code>/data</code> directory directly from application root</li>
<li>for data model think a <code>/data_models</code> directory directly from application root as it could be used by many system components</li>
<li>always outline a <code>/test</code> directory</li>
<li>always outline a <code>static</code> directory (preferable at application root level) for any kind of static files (style files, different data, etc) - doing so will be much easier to protect it on production system and to give "right security fio right persons</li>
<li>in most situations a <code>libutils</code> directory is good; it can accommodate all project specific general purpose modules</li>
<li>not as last case, have in mind that application is better to be put on an automated backup system, being this just a simple script, and who does that should have a simple and clear scheme of <em>what to backup</em>; also when ned to restore data from an old backup, people should be able to find the right places without making <em>"special analysis"</em> for that</li>
<li>be consistent, avoid changing directories and file names as this could have a <strong><em>severe</em></strong> impact on code</li>
</ul>
<p>For small projects it couldn't be necessary this section as probably "everything" are located in one to three directories. </p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81006-system-api-interfaces-optional">810.06 System API &amp; Interfaces (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>Here is the section which describe the system <strong>interfaces</strong>. Of course these should come from (or go to update) <em>architecture</em>.</p>
<p>For each system interface should be outlined:</p>
<ul>
<li>an unique <strong>code</strong> (name)</li>
<li>a <strong>description</strong> ref what does and what is good for</li>
<li>the interface <strong>protocol</strong> often aka handshaking model</li>
<li>the interface <strong>API</strong> in terms of methods, arguments, returns, usability, etc</li>
<li>any other relevant applicable conditions or contexts</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81040-system-concepts-in-detail-update-of-120-cpts-optional">810.40 System Concepts in Detail - update of <em>120-CPTS</em> (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>This section role is to update (clarify or add details) ref to concepts presented in <em><code>120-CTPS</code></em> document as result of different things new or changed along development.</p>
<p>Also, here could appear new concepts but, normally, this indicates a poor analysis process (or incomplete understanding of what system should do). Anyway, <strong>new concepts must be clear and visible marked</strong> and should be <strong>notified</strong> to project management area as they could be subject of change management.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81045-licensing-model-update-of-13004-optional">810.45 Licensing Model - update of <em>130.04</em> (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>This is a dedicated section where licensing model can be explained / detailed. Usual here are information regarding volumetric usable for licensing (as system is aware of and can count them) additionally to <em><code>130.04</code></em> document. The information provided is used by product manager and commercial departments to derive final <em>product licensing models</em>.</p>
<p>Essentially the information provided here will update <em><code>130.04 Licensing Editions &amp; Pricing</code></em> document, as this kind of information become clear along development process.</p>
<p>Guidelines and licensing metrics examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep a dedicated section in <em><code>130.04</code></em> document this being too technical for commercial use; therefore will be easier to clean commercial information</li>
<li>metric ex: named users - the registered enabled users in system</li>
<li>metric ex: size of uploaded files</li>
<li>metric ex: number of days for subscriptions</li>
<li>metric ex: number of tokens / certificates given</li>
<li>metric ex: number of days to allow downloading some information</li>
<li>metric combinations</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81046-product-features-update-of-13001-required">810.46 Product Features - update of <em>130.01</em> (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>This is a dedicated section where product features can be explained more clear and detailed. Therefore is an update to <em><code>130.01 Datasheet</code></em> document.</p>
<p>For smaller projects only <em><code>130.02 Overview</code></em> will be updated, but if 130.01 exists, this should be updated, the other (130.02) being a subset of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, this information is also marked (as more raw form) in CHANGELOG, RELNOTE, README files.</p>
<p>These information will definitely contribute to <em><code>130.01 Product Datasheet</code></em> and <em><code>130.02 Product Overview</code></em> documents, as being known that it becomes more clear and defined in development process.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81050-to-81079-appendices-optional">810.50 to 810.79 Appendices (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>This sections reserves numbers / codes starting with <strong><code>50</code></strong> up to <strong><code>79</code></strong> for different appendices. Normally, appendices are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>if is more useful to separate the information as being large in most cases, and put it on a separate file</li>
<li>the information does not need attention when reading all document, but is containing <em>details</em> that are useful for "advanced readings" or a deeper understanding of information domain in subject</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-81080-to-81099-design-sketches-optional">810.80 to 810.99 Design Sketches (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>This sections reserves numbers / codes starting with <strong><code>50</code></strong> up to <strong><code>79</code></strong> for different appendices. Design sketches are sometimes (often) very useful to be as separated files in their raw formats in order to be used latter in other materials (for example by marketing / branding departments).</p>
<p>Pay attention that these sketches could be duplicates of <em><code>190-SKTD Sketches &amp; Technical Diagrams</code></em>, so be aware and try avoid as much as possible duplicates.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks to 810 DSGN section</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes (especially in case of small / med projects) it is easier or required to have one single file - in this case just name the file using <code>ALL</code> instead of a volume / section code and "put all together" in that file as "volumes" / sections</p>
<h3 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-820-sint-system-internals">820-SINT System Internals</h3>
<p>These are very technical and specialized sections ref system (internals). They can be simple references to <em>notorious / known algorithms</em> or detailed technical notes about <em>how is implemented</em>, for example (and most often) for states.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-82001-system-states-optional">820.01 System States (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>Here are described various <strong>system states</strong> used in development process. <em>This section applies to systems where there are states</em>. Preferred forms of diagramming follow UML notation standards (they are not excluding one each other):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>state diagrams</em></strong> (ALWAYS <strong>REQUIRED</strong>) - which relieves all the states (in subject) and <em>transitions</em> between them</li>
<li><strong><em>sequence diagrams</em></strong> (OPTIONAL) - which add the <em>temporal</em> information to state diagrams</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-82002-system-interfaces-bus-es-optional">820.02 System Interfaces &amp; BUS-es (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>Here should be described each system interface (following the guidelines from section <em>810-DSGN System Design 06 - System API &amp; Interfaces</em>). The <code>BUS</code> term means in this document almost the same thing, but is just a more hardware term. It is quoted here because it is so common that, often, this term will be found.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-82003-synchronization-clocks-optional">820.03 Synchronization &amp; Clocks (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>Here is clearly a very specialized section regarding <em>clocks</em>. This is in almost cases REQUIRED if the system is (or part of) a distributed one, where clock synchronization is "something" required.</p>
<p>If present, it should be present both <strong>logical</strong> and <strong>physical</strong> clocks, how are they implemented, if use some "known" algorithms (and a reference to them), sync issues, context conditions for good operations, etc.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-82004-algorithms-strategies-optional">820.04 Algorithms &amp; Strategies (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>This section is "self descriptive" as name. Clearly, if there are <em>known algorithms</em>, they shouldn't be described here in detail, but a few words (ref how and why are used) must be written and a reference made (or internet, ie Wikipedia, or book).</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-82090-toolstack-notes-optional">820.90 Toolstack notes (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<p>Here should be various notes relevant for toolstack and "outside" normal things:</p>
<ul>
<li>special remarks, ie how to, which parts / components, etc</li>
<li>where a framework, library, etc can be found</li>
<li>warnings and other known issues (the designer should know them or the most important of them)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-830-dev-development-mandatory">830-DEV Development (MANDATORY)</h3>
<p>This is not a document section. In this folder it is supposed to keep all system code and it is organized as project require.</p>
<h3 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-840-test-system-test">840-TEST System Test</h3>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-84001-test-plan-required">840.01 Test plan (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>Here it will reside the plan for testing. Normally this should be as simple as possible, being "just for your information" at development level. What is really important (especially for own time planning perspective) is what in Project Management discipline is named "<strong><em>WHO - DOES -WHAT - WHEN</em></strong>".</p>
<p>So a simply "agenda like" will be enough. Not details, not why, not specificities, etc. The WHAT part should be exactly what respective person wil have to do, in fact indicating a <em>test case number / id</em>.</p>
<p>Also it will be very good to specify the nature of test:</p>
<ul>
<li>"white" test - ie with "entry" to code level</li>
<li>"black" test - aka functional testing, just "looking &amp; exercising" from an end user perspective</li>
</ul>
<p>Most (almost all) tests of here will be in "black" category, as long as code-in testing is the developer's responsibility for "alpha" releases testing.</p>
<p>Of course there are many other test that should be done (integration, acceptance) but they are not in scope of this methodology, but more in Project Management one.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-84002-test-cases-scenarios-required">840.02 Test cases / scenarios (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>A test scenario should be outlined for every system functionality (see <em>810-DSGN System Design</em> section <em>05a - System Processes</em>). "Test cases" is a list with all test scenarios, ie the table of content or index of them. The difference is so subtle that in most cases they are uses as synonyms for the same thing: test scenario.</p>
<p>Every test scenario should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>unique code</strong> / number / identifier so will give us the possibility to reference it latter</li>
<li>a brief <strong>description</strong> of what the functionality under test should (is expected) do</li>
<li>the (ordered) <em>NORMAL</em> <strong>steps</strong> that should be done for functionality to fulfill it; pay attention, these steps should reflect the end user manual or help or working procedure as they should be here exactly how an end user would do</li>
<li><strong>expected results</strong> (for a <em>PASS</em>) the system must "produce" - here a good practice if these are the nature of "real numbers" or "too fine grained dates, as timestamps" is to specify the accepted tolerances (if they are and if appear in documentation)</li>
<li>any <strong>condition</strong> that must be met / fulfilled by system as in documentation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-84004-test-report-required">840.04 Test Report (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>The test report should be a mix between <em>test plan</em>, <em>test cases</em> and <em>test scenarios</em>. In essence this will be a <strong>list</strong> with all <strong>tests</strong> (test cases), <strong>who</strong> executed the test (test plan) for further questions and <strong>result as PASS / FAIL</strong> (test scenarios).</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep it simple</li>
<li>it will be just an input for <em>Release Notes</em>; not subject for any organizational regulations</li>
<li>no details (as reasons, motivational facts, etc)</li>
<li>just PASS / FAIL; the customer is not interested about why and if, then are other persons who should address that issues</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-84090-release-notes-required">840.90 Release Notes (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>This deliverable result as a "humanize" compilation (clean, choose words, etc) of <em>820-SINT System Internals</em>  section <em>04 Test Report</em> and it will <strong><em>accompany the released packaged</em></strong> as required part of it.</p>
<h3 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-880-rlse-system-release">880-RLSE System Release</h3>
<p>All these parts / sections aim to have a <strong>PACKAGE</strong> (ie, required for a system <em>product</em>) that accompany a release. They will (finally) be "what a client see" ref a system update / upgrade package. <strong>It will be "its primary / main source of information" in deciding that will get this package or not</strong>.</p>
<p>Being deliverables with commercial impact they have a <em>literal code</em> not only a numerical one. This code is also unique so it can be used as Alternate Key.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-88010-feat-product-features-update-of-13001-required">880.10 FEAT Product Features - update of <em>130.01</em> (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>It will be get / obtained by a (re)compilation (following mainly a commercial facelift) of <em>840-TEST System Test</em> section <em>90 Release Notes</em>.</p>
<p>Basically in (after) this step the <em><code>130.01 Product Datasheet</code></em> document should be updated, or to create a new one based on it. Idea is that here, this document will <strong>BE A FULLY COMMERCIAL</strong> one.</p>
<p>The same mentions (please read the previous sections) apply here ref to <em>130.01</em> &amp; <em>130.02</em> documents. If you're here probably the size / complexity of the system is of nature that require for <em><code>130.01 Product Datasheet</code></em>.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-88020-elpri-editions-licensing-pricing-update-of-13004-required">880.20 ELPRI Editions, Licensing &amp; Pricing - update of <em>130.04</em> (REQUIRED)</h4>
<p>This should be the "commercial form" (as more elaborated and with a commercial facelift) of <em>130-SKIT Sales Kit(s)</em> section <em>130.04-SKIT Licensing Editions Pricing</em>. Essentially this is the update and "commercial facelift" of <em><code>130.04 Licensing Editions &amp; Pricing</code></em> document.</p>
<p>The same mentions (please read the previous sections) apply here ref to <em>130.01</em> &amp; <em>130.02</em> documents. If you're here probably the size / complexity of the system is of nature that require for <em><code>130.01 Product Datasheet</code></em>.</p>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-88030-euma-end-user-manuals">880.30 EUMA End User Manuals</h4>
<p>Here are the manuals that will mainly address <em>end users</em> (business area) of product. These are usual of two kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>full</strong> / complete manuals - these are "monolithic" documents containing all information needed for end users, doesn't matter what kind of end user is reading it (a very common example is "<em>Quick Reference Guide</em>")</li>
<li><strong>partial</strong> manuals - these are addressed to a more target segment of end users; one manual for a category of end users (typical example are "<em>Work Procedure</em>" documents)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, regardless the enumerated type, our recommendation is to specify the TARGET AUDIENCE for each manual as being a very useful practice.</p>
<h5 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-88030-eumaqg-end-user-quick-guide-required">880.30 EUMA.QG End User Quick Guide (REQUIRED)</h5>
<p>This kind of manual is intended as a very quick reference where users will find easily what they need or where to look for details. It is a ALL IN ONE manual style containing "nothing about all" as style of information.</p>
<p>As guidelines, it should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>a brief overview referring functional aspects, not technical ones</li>
<li>a quick installation procedure or "how to make it usable first time" - no details, no options; just a simple, default installation</li>
<li>a brief tutorial ref "how to use it first time" or "first steps"</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-88030-eumawpnn-work-procedure-nn-optional">880.30 EUMA.WP<em>nn</em> Work Procedure <em>nn</em> (OPTIONAL)</h5>
<p>As general rule a "work procedure" is a description of how to do a specific, concrete and atomic activity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Specific</strong> means that activity is specific to business that system is implementing</p>
<p><strong>Concrete</strong> means that activity is not a generic one, but a very concrete, one of the known activity for targeted audience</p>
<p><strong>Atomic</strong> means the respective activity is not normally breakable in smaller parts with the risk of inconsistencies and normally is executed in full up to finish, ie, technically speaking not let open states(!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As good and best practice, the work procedures package should be accompanied by a <em>catalog</em> document which is an index with all work procedures, a table at least code and name foe convenience ordered by procedure name.</p>
<p>Procedure content guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>code</strong> the activity and mark this code; remark that usually is a number, those <em>nn</em> from document title; this code is subject of project conventions</li>
<li><strong>name</strong> the activity just procedured as it is known in business; try to keep a "human name"</li>
<li>specify the intended <strong>audience</strong> as business roles (<em>attn not system, but business role if they are not the same</em>)</li>
<li>specify the <strong>navigation path</strong> to achieve this activity in system</li>
<li>specify all <strong>steps</strong> that must be followed to successfully fulfill activity</li>
<li>for steps give an aid using <strong>screen captures</strong> and annotate them</li>
<li>give indications ref every <strong>field</strong> that appear on that step; be clear, make references where from that information is coming, etc</li>
<li>do not suppose anything; just explain everything even it seems simple or annoying</li>
<li><strong>number steps</strong> as can be referred easier</li>
<li>for each step give <strong>hints</strong> ref expected results and system behavior (surprises are not something good at job), identically even it seems obvious for you</li>
</ul>
<p>As mandatory work procedures (applicable for any system) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>System navigation</em></strong> - this contains specific instructions ref how access a functionality in system, usual the menu path and other relevant info</li>
<li><strong><em>Authentication in system</em></strong> - explain how to login, logout, change user, change password, etc</li>
<li><strong><em>System indicators</em></strong> - explain what are good for and how to use all system icons, widgets iconic butons, status indicators, etc - if it is small enough this procedure is included in navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, keep in mind that many users will print these procedures, so keep a standard paper format and try to include them in <strong>system help</strong> module.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Where to find out what are those activities that need to have a work procedure?</em></strong> Remember, there is a document with system processes (<em>810.05a System Processes</em>) - this is the place where to start.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="appendix_b_dsgn_content_index-88030-adma-administration-manuals">880.30 ADMA Administration Manuals</h4>
<p>Here are the manuals that will mainly address <em>administrators</em> (IT area) of product. These kind of manuals should address at least the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li>current system maintenance</li>
<li>installation and first configuration</li>
<li>initial system credentials</li>
<li>some disclaimers regarding initial credentials clean</li>
<li>how to make some safety copies</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These manuals should not contain detailed information (ar advanced information) regarding administration as this is usually subject of payment. The same thing apply for service(ing) procedures / diagrams and so on.</p>

<p>CC0 1.0 Universal</p>
<pre><code>CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED

</code></pre>
<p>Statement of Purpose</p>
<p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").</p>
<p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.</p>
<p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.</p></section></div>
