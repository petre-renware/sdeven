## 0.6

### 0.6.4-released (220724 still wip...)

* 220724c final checks. RELEASE 0.6
* 220724a index document (code 00) add sdeven logo inside
* 220718b updated `SDEVEN.30_RENVER.md` with a map "branches by qualifiers"

### 0.6.3-alpha (220718 09:06)

* 220718a a document was proposed: `status_report` as being a little bit more oriented to sw dev (versions, technical data, etc) and so it is not intended to replace normal Project Management status report, but it can / should be used by Project Manager / Technical Manager to sustain its one (this report being issued by a senior developer or team leader)

### 0.6.2-alpha (220617 06:15)

* 220617b updated release management policies, clarified and unified content structure: in release management doc and in appendix B
* 220617a updated `Appendix_B_DSGN_Content_Index.md` for small corrections

### 0.6.1-beta (220616 19:50)

* 220616a update release management policies - applied all codes from old methodology and made a "**Release Structure**"
* 220517a a new chapter 55.RENTRACE (file: `\wk_crt_proposalsSDEVEN.55_RENTRACE.md') ref CHANGELOG and RELNOTE was introduced, ide doc updated in same proposals directory
